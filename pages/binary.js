# What are binary options?

Binary options are exotic financial instruments originating from the CBOE in 1974, becoming widely available in 2008. They function on a simple premise, allowing traders to bet on whether an asset's price will be above or below a certain point at expiration, essentially a "yes or no" wager. Modern binary options vary in expiration times, with many platforms focusing on short-term durations, typically less than a day.

# Common binary option types

There are three primary binary call/put options:

1. Binary options trading includes several types of contracts, each based on the prediction of an asset's price movement. 
2. The High/Low option involves predicting whether the asset's price will be higher or lower than a certain point at expiration. 
3. The Touch/No-Touch option is about whether the asset's price will touch a specific level before expiry. 

Lastly, the Boundary option requires a bet that the asset's price will stay within a certain range, not exceeding or falling below predetermined levels.

## Key points

Binary options trading is highly speculative and risky, leading to bans in the EU and UK. The scarcity of regulated brokers adds to the financial risk. Companies like Payback specialize in assisting victims of binary options fraud. It's crucial to thoroughly research platforms and read user reviews before engaging in trading. Always invest only what you can afford to lose to minimize potential financial damage.

# Are binary options a scam or legit?

Binary options trading is considered highly speculative and risky. While legal in the US under strict regulations, binary options have been banned in the EU and UK due to their association with scams and the high risk involved. The market's reputation is marred by its gambling-like nature and the ethical concerns surrounding certain regulatory bodies. It's seen as a zero-sum game, often compared unfavorably with professional investing or speculation.

## Binary options robot scams

Binary options robots, often pitched to day traders involved in speculative markets such as forex, are marketed as tools for managing your trading account. These robots, requiring access to your account or an API, claim to execute trades on your behalf. However, the sales tactics for these robots can be aggressive, promising unrealistic returns and success rates. They may also use enticing visuals to suggest a lavish lifestyle achievable through their use, all of which are common red flags for scams in this space.

## Binary options software scams

Binary options software, often labeled as using 'advanced AI' or 'machine learning,' promises significant returns. However, many claims about these sophisticated algorithms are misleading, with the actual profit coming from the sale of the software rather than its performance in the market. Like robot scams, it's important to question aggressive marketing, high returns promises, and depictions of luxurious lifestyles.

## Binary options trading scams

The binary options market is rife with scams, partly due to regulatory bans pushing brokers to less-regulated countries. This shift has led to a proliferation of unregistered brokers worldwide, often providing unreliable or fraudulent data feeds. Rapid, last-moment fluctuations in bids and asks can result in significant, sometimes double-sided, losses. A potential safeguard is to deal exclusively with regulated brokers, though they are rare and not entirely risk-free.

## Binary options signal scams

Signal scams are particularly widespread in financial markets, including binary options, where they involve selling trade signals for a fee. These signals are often distributed through various communication channels like Telegram. Generally, it's advisable to steer clear of signal providers, as their primary motive is to profit from subscription fees rather than offering genuinely profitable trading insights.

# Next Steps After Losing Money to Binary Options Scams

Being scammed by binary options can feel like a dead-end, but there's hope. At Payback, we're seasoned in reclaiming funds from binary options fraudsters. Our process involves collaborating with your card company for chargebacks, supported by a dedicated caseworker for your case. Start by assessing your situation with our Success Calculator, and gain confidence from the experiences shared in our testimonials.

## How to avoid Binary Options trading scams

For safer binary options trading in the U.S., ensure brokers are regulated by the CFTC or SEC, and verify their license details. Exercise due diligence by consulting diverse user reviews, and be skeptical of exclusive binary options review sites, which might not be objective. Consider the broker's location and personally test their data for authenticity, watching for unusual price shifts near trade expirations to avoid potential scams.

                Yes, binary options are legal in the United States, subject to

                Binary options robots operate primarily in two ways: one
                involves an executable software that trades automatically based
                on pre-set parameters, and the other requires sharing your
                trading account information with the robot, allowing it to trade
                on your behalf.

                and signals, offering a hands-off approach to trading by
                replicating the trading strategies and decisions of experienced
                traders directly in your account.
