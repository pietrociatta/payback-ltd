            "content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The world of cryptocurrency has undoubtedly brought about a financial revolution, promising decentralization, financial inclusion, and potentially enormous profits for early investors.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, with the rise of cryptocurrencies, there has also been an alarming increase in crypto investment scams. Among the most prevalent are Ponzi schemes and fake Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).</span></p>\n<h2><strong>How Do Crypto Ponzi Schemes Work?</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Ponzi scheme is a type of fraudulent investment scheme that promises high returns with little or no risk to investors.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Named after Charles Ponzi, who became infamous for his fraudulent investment operation in the early 20th century, these schemes use funds from new investors to pay returns to earlier investors, creating the illusion of a profitable enterprise.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here&#8217;s how a typical Ponzi scheme in the world of cryptocurrency works:</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Attracting Investors</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The scam begins when the fraudster sets up a crypto investment opportunity, often with a catchy name and a compelling pitch.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They may claim to have developed a revolutionary trading algorithm, mining operation, or some other secret formula for generating incredible returns. Promises of guaranteed, high daily or monthly returns are made to lure unsuspecting investors.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Early Payouts</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Initially, the scammer may make small payouts to the first batch of investors. These payouts are often used as testimonials to attract even more victims. This creates the illusion of a legitimate, profitable enterprise and encourages new investors to pour in their funds.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Recruiting More Investors</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To sustain the scheme, the fraudster continuously recruits new investors. The funds from these newcomers are used to pay returns to earlier investors, creating a cycle that perpetuates the scam. As long as the scheme keeps growing, it can appear sustainable.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Collapse and Disappearance</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, the Ponzi scheme will collapse when the scammer can no longer recruit enough new investors to pay returns to earlier participants. When this happens, the fraudster usually disappears with whatever funds are left, leaving the majority of investors with significant losses.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>How To Recognize a Crypto Ponzi Scheme</strong></h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consistent and Unrealistic Returns</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most significant red flags of a Ponzi scheme is the promise of consistently high and guaranteed returns. In the world of legitimate investments, there are no guarantees, and any investment offering a consistent, risk-free return should be viewed with serious skepticism.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lack of Transparency</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ponzi schemes often lack transparency regarding their operations, team members, or business model. Legitimate investment opportunities provide comprehensive information about their strategies, teams, and goals.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pressure to Recruit</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scammers running Ponzi schemes often pressure investors to recruit others. They may offer referral bonuses or incentives to encourage you to bring in more victims. Legitimate investments do not depend on recruitment for profits.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fluctuating Story</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be cautious of crypto investment opportunities that frequently change their narrative or business model. Consistency is key in the legitimate financial world.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unregistered or Unregulated</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ponzi schemes are often unregistered with relevant authorities and operate outside regulatory frameworks. Always verify the legitimacy of an investment opportunity and check if it complies with local financial regulations.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>How Do Fake ICOs Work?</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) gained popularity in the cryptocurrency space, scammers saw an opportunity to exploit the hype and enthusiasm surrounding these crowdfunding events.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fake ICOs have thus become a new frontier for crypto investment scams, costing investors millions of dollars.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fake ICOs involve the creation of a fake cryptocurrency project, complete with a whitepaper, a flashy website, and enticing promises of revolutionary technology.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These scams can be elaborate and convincing, making it challenging for investors to distinguish them from legitimate ICOs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here&#8217;s how a fake ICO typically operates:</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. The Creation of a Token</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scammers create a new cryptocurrency token for their fake projects. This token is often given a catchy name and may claim to solve a particular problem or offer unique features.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A whitepaper outlining the project&#8217;s goals and technology is also produced, but it is usually filled with plagiarized or nonsensical content.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Building Hype</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To attract investors, scammers generate hype through social media, forums, and fake endorsements from celebrities or industry experts. They may also create a sense of urgency by claiming that the ICO is about to close, pushing potential investors to act quickly.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Accepting Investments</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investors are often encouraged to send their existing cryptocurrencies (usually Bitcoin or Ethereum) to the scammer&#8217;s wallet address in exchange for the new tokens.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since most ICOs involve sending funds directly to a smart contract, investors have little control over their funds once they&#8217;ve made the transaction.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Disappearing Act</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the scammer has collected a significant amount of cryptocurrency, they disappear, leaving investors with worthless tokens and substantial financial losses.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>How To Recognize a Fake ICO</strong></h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lack of Team Information</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fake ICOs often provide vague or entirely fabricated information about their team members. Legitimate projects typically have a well-documented team with links to their social profiles and professional backgrounds.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plagiarized Whitepaper</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many fake ICOs copy content from legitimate projects or produce whitepapers filled with technical jargon that makes no sense upon closer examination.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unrealistic Promises</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be cautious of ICOs that promise exorbitant returns with minimal risk. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FOMO Tactics</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scammers often use fear of missing out (FOMO) tactics to pressure investors into making quick decisions. They may claim that the ICO is about to close or that prices will skyrocket.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lack of Transparency</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Legitimate ICOs provide detailed information about their project&#8217;s technology, use of funds, and roadmap. If these details are missing or unclear, it&#8217;s a warning sign.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Protecting Yourself from Cryptocurrency Scams</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cryptocurrency investment scams, including Ponzi schemes and fake ICOs, pose a significant threat to unsuspecting investors. Learning how to recognize these scams and taking measures to protect yourself is crucial if you are involved in the world of digital assets.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By staying informed about the latest crypto-threats and exercising caution, you can reduce the risk of falling victim to these deceptive schemes and enjoy the benefits of legitimate cryptocurrency investments.</span></p>\n",

            "content": "\n<p></p>\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stock trading has long been a favored avenue for investors to grow their wealth, offering options for both short- and long-term investing. However, the allure of quick profits in the stock market also exposes investors to various fraudulent stock trading schemes.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most notorious of these schemes is the “pump and dump” scheme. Whether you’re considering getting into the stock market or already own a portfolio of stocks, it’s important to understand how to protect your investments from pump-and-dump scams.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What Is a Pump and Dump Scheme?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A pump and dump scheme is a fraudulent practice — more specifically, a type of securities fraud — that involves artificially inflating the price of a stock to attract unsuspecting investors.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the stock&#8217;s price has been artificially pumped up, the orchestrators of the scheme quickly sell their shares, causing the stock&#8217;s price to plummet.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This leaves those who bought in at the inflated prices with significant losses while the scammers make a hefty profit. They then rinse and repeat for another stock.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Do Pump and Dump Schemes Work?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pump-and-dump scammers usually choose micro- and small-cap stocks because they are easier to manipulate the prices of. They also often choose stocks that are available on over-the-counter securities exchanges, as these are less regulated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the scammers have picked a stock to pump and dump, their pump-and-dump scheme works like this:</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Promotion</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first stage of a pump-and-dump scheme involves promoters who disseminate false or misleading information about a particular stock. They may use various channels such as social media, online forums, newsletters, or even cold-calling to tout the stock&#8217;s supposed potential.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These promotions often greatly exaggerate the company&#8217;s prospects for near-term profits, making it seem like a once-in-a-lifetime investment opportunity.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Price Inflation</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the stock gains attention and more investors rush in to buy, the demand for the stock increases, causing its price to rise. This creates a self-fulfilling prophecy, as more people are enticed to jump on the bandwagon, further driving up the price.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Sell-Off</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the stock price reaches a certain level or the schemers feel they&#8217;ve attracted enough investors, they start selling their own shares, taking advantage of the inflated prices. This sudden influx of shares into the market puts downward pressure on the stock&#8217;s price.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Investor Losses</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the schemers out of the market and the artificial support removed, the stock&#8217;s price usually crashes. Investors who bought in at the inflated prices are left with substantial losses, while the orchestrators of the scheme walk away with their ill-gotten gains.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How To Protect Your Investments from Pump and Dump Schemes</span></h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conduct Due Diligence</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first and most crucial step to protect your investments is to conduct thorough research. Always investigate the companies you are considering investing in to make sure any information you may hear about them from third parties is legit.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look for reliable sources of information, such as financial statements, news articles, and reputable financial analysts&#8217; reports. Avoid making investment decisions based solely on tips from unknown sources.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beware of Hype</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be cautious of stocks that are aggressively promoted with grandiose claims. If a stock is being touted as a “can&#8217;t-miss opportunity” or a “surefire winner,” it&#8217;s a red flag. Legitimate investments rarely require such aggressive promotion, and there are no guarantees in stock investing.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Verify Information</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Verify the accuracy of any information you come across, especially if it’s sent or provided to you out of the blue from unknown sources.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check whether the company&#8217;s financials and business prospects align with the claims being made. Be especially skeptical of claims that lack concrete evidence or rely on vague promises.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoid Micro- and Small-Cap Stocks</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Micro- and small-cap stocks are more volatile and more susceptible to pump-and-dump schemes. Unless you’re an experienced day trader, it’s better to avoid these types of stocks and focus on investing in large-cap stocks, which are more stable.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watch for Pumping Signals</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep an eye out for unusual trading activity, such as a sudden spike in trading volume or a rapid increase in a stock&#8217;s price with no clear fundamental reason. These can be signs of a pump and dump in progress.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Set Realistic Expectations</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s essential to have realistic expectations about your investments. Understand that the stock market involves risks, and no investment is guaranteed to produce substantial gains in a short period. Avoid the temptation to chase after stocks that promise quick riches.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diversify Your Portfolio</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diversification can help spread risk across different assets, reducing your exposure to any single investment. By holding a diversified portfolio, you are less likely to be severely impacted by the downfall of one stock due to a pump-and-dump scheme.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use Stop-Loss Orders</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Implement stop-loss orders when trading stocks. These orders automatically sell your shares if the stock&#8217;s price falls to a specified level. While they can&#8217;t prevent losses entirely, they can limit the extent of your losses in case a pump-and-dump scheme unfolds.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Report Suspected Fraud</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you come across a suspected pump-and-dump scheme, report it to the appropriate authorities, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reporting fraudulent activity can help protect other investors and potentially lead to legal actions against the perpetrators.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wrapping Up</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pump and dump schemes are a dark side of the stock market that prey on unsuspecting investors seeking quick profits.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since this type of fraud revolves around real stocks, it can be easy for unsuspecting new investors to fall for a pump-and-dump scam in the hopes of turning a quick profit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it’s important to remember that, as with any type of investment opportunity, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Newer investors should focus more on stable, long-term investments, as well as implement the other best practices we discussed above, to avoid pump-and-dump scams and protect their hard-earned investment money from scammers.</span></p>",

            "content": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The allure of making quick profits in the world of forex trading has drawn countless individuals into this financial market — and where there are investors, there are scammers.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forex, short for foreign exchange, offers the potential for substantial returns on investments, but it also harbors risks, including the threat of numerous different types of scams.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forex trading scams are on the rise, preying on the uninformed and the inexperienced looking for a quick return on investment.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this blog post, we will explore some common red flags associated with different forex trading scams and provide valuable insights on how to protect yourself from falling victim to them.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>The Forex Market: A Brief Overview</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before delving into the specifics of forex scams, let&#8217;s start by ensuring you have a basic understanding of the forex market.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a daily trading volume exceeding $6 trillion, it is the largest and most liquid financial market globally.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In essence, forex trading involves buying one currency while simultaneously selling another, speculating on the exchange rate fluctuations between them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While plenty of people successfully make money on the forex market, it is considered a more high-risk investment than standard stock trading, and that’s without even taking into account the many forex trading scams that are out there.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n<h2><strong>Common Forex Trading Scams<br></strong></h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signal Sellers</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signal sellers are individuals or companies that claim to provide trading signals, or tips, that can help you make profitable trades. They often promise high success rates and guaranteed profits for a fee.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, many of these signal services are fraudulent, and their signals can lead to significant losses.</span></p>\n<p><b>Red Flags and How To Avoid Them:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Beware of services that promise unrealistic returns with no risk or losses. Legitimate trading involves risks, and no one can guarantee profits consistently.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ponzi Schemes</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ponzi schemes in the forex market also involve promising high returns with little or no risk. Scammers attract investors to these schemes by claiming to use their funds for forex trading, essentially turning their money into quick profits that they promise to return to the investors.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scammers pay returns to early investors using the capital of newer investors, creating a fake appearance of profitability (like a pyramid scheme). Eventually, when new investments dry up, the scheme collapses, and many unsuspecting, eager investors lose their money.</span></p>\n<p><b>Red Flags and How To Avoid Them:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Be skeptical of investment opportunities that promise “guaranteed” or excessively high returns with little to no risk. Conduct due diligence and research the company or individual offering the investment.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unregulated Brokers</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there are legitimate forex brokers out there, some forex brokers operate without proper regulation, making them fertile ground for scams. Unregulated brokers can manipulate prices, refuse withdrawals, or even disappear altogether with investors&#8217; funds.</span></p>\n<p><b>Red Flags and How To Avoid Them:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Always choose a reputable and regulated forex broker. Research the broker&#8217;s regulatory status and verify their credentials with relevant authorities.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Robot or Automated Trading Scams</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scammers often promote automated trading systems or robots that claim to make profitable trades on your behalf. These systems may be sold with impressive backtest “results,” but they often fail to deliver in live trading conditions.</span></p>\n<p><b>Red Flags and How To Avoid Them:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Be cautious of systems that promise effortless profits without any human involvement. Thoroughly research and test any automated trading software before committing your capital.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Phony Investment Courses</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some scammers offer expensive forex trading courses, promising to teach you the secrets of successful trading. These courses often lack valuable content and are designed solely to generate income for the fraudsters.</span></p>\n<p><b>Red Flags and How To Avoid Them:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Investigate the credentials of the course provider and seek reviews from previous students. Legitimate education should be transparent and backed by solid testimonials.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How To Protect Yourself from Forex Trading Scams</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that we&#8217;ve identified common forex trading scams, along with their red flags and how to avoid them, let&#8217;s explore some more general ways to protect yourself from falling victim to these schemes.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Education is Key</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Invest in your own knowledge by learning about the forex market in depth. Make sure you understand the fundamentals of trading, technical and fundamental analysis, risk management, and trading strategies. A well-informed trader is less likely to be deceived.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choose a Regulated Broker</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Select a forex broker that is regulated by a reputable financial authority in your region. Regulatory bodies help ensure that brokers adhere to strict standards and follow ethical practices.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beware of Unrealistic Promises</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be skeptical of any opportunity that promises guaranteed profits with little or no risk. Remember that trading involves risk, and there are no guarantees of profit — if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Verify Information</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Research and verify any forex-related information presented to you. Check the background and track record of any individual or company offering forex services or investment opportunities.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use Caution with Automated Systems</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are considering using automated trading software or robots, thoroughly research them and read legitimate third-party opinions and reviews. Beware of systems that promise overnight wealth. When in doubt, it’s best to avoid forex robot trading platforms altogether.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoid Pressure Tactics</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scammers often use high-pressure tactics to rush you into making decisions. Take your time to evaluate any opportunity or investment, and don’t give into your emotions when it comes to trading forex (or anything, for that matter).</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stay Informed</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep up to date with the latest news and developments in the forex market. Being aware of market conditions and trends can help you make informed decisions and avoid potential scams.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conclusion</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the forex market offers substantial opportunities for profit, it is not without its risks, including the threat of scams.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By being vigilant, educating yourself, and following the guidelines mentioned in this article, you can protect yourself from falling victim to forex trading scams.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember that in the world of forex trading, the most valuable asset you have is your knowledge and ability to make informed decisions.</span></p>",

            "content": "<p>If you&rsquo;ve lost money to a scam or fraud, then you may be wondering if there&rsquo;s a way to DIY a chargeback claim, rather than instructing a company or solicitor to act on your behalf. The answer is yes &#8211; if you&rsquo;ve got the time, and certain key conditions are met, then there is the option to pursue the case yourself, for free.</p>\n<p>Several factors will come into play when it comes to a DIY chargeback claim, and this route may not be right for everyone, but keep reading to find out how to go about attempting to reclaim your lost funds if you&rsquo;ve been conned by an unscrupulous trader or fallen victim to a dodgy broker.</p>\n<h2>Raise the Issue with the Company</h2>\n<p>Sometimes, a bank or card issuer will expect you to have raised the complaint with the company that you feel has scammed you before they will accept a chargeback request. If this is the case, then it is worth writing a formal letter or email of complaint to the broker or organization, if they are still in business and/or traceable.</p>\n<p>Once you have sent this communication, you will usually be required to wait for fifteen days for their response. At this point, if they have either not responded, or have communicated that they are not willing to refund your cash, you can proceed with the chargeback process, as outlined below.</p>\n<h2>Contact Your Bank</h2>\n<p>If the payment you made to the scam company occurred less than one hundred and twenty days ago, then you may be able to resolve matters yourself. First, get in contact with your bank or card issuer, and ask them to reverse this payment. If the bank agrees that the transaction was illegitimate, then they&rsquo;ll uphold your claim and refund your money.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting, though, that the bank could rebut your argument, or, the merchant may challenge it with compelling evidence to show that the transaction was legitimate; in either of these cases, it is likely that the chargeback won&rsquo;t be granted.</p>\n<h2>Bureaucratic Nightmare</h2>\n<p>For those wishing to claim a chargeback from their issuing bank, it&rsquo;s worth noting, however, that there are a range of issues or complications that can arise that can make the process time-consuming and stressful. For example, strict timescales, red tape, and the lengthy nature of the paperwork and processes can make the system difficult to navigate, and mean you&rsquo;re not successful in getting the chargeback you could be entitled to.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s also important to know the difference, before making a challenge, between a genuine case to request a chargeback in the case that fraud has been committed, for example, as opposed to a case where an investment may have been lost, but in legitimate circumstances.</p>\n<p>If the issuing bank decides that the latter has occurred, rather than the former, then not only will a charge reversal attempt be unsuccessful, but this could have negative consequences for both the consumer and the merchant.</p>\n<h2>What If My Bank Refuses to Reverse the Charges?</h2>\n<p>Your bank or card issuer may refuse to refund the charges as you&rsquo;ve requested. If this is the case then your options are limited. In the first instance, you could consider writing a formal letter of complaint to your issuing bank, and ask them to look again at the case, highlighting the reasons that you believe that the transaction you&rsquo;re disputing was a fraudulent one and the impact that this has had on you.</p>\n<p>If the bank is not willing to re-examine the case, or if, when it&rsquo;s assessed again, a chargeback is still refused, then your only other recourse is to instruct an attorney to fight your case for you &#8211; obviously, this is likely to be at significant expense.</p>\n<h2>What Do I Need to Make a Claim?</h2>\n<p>The more evidence you have, the better, when it comes to making a chargeback claim. Before contacting your bank or card issuer, make sure you have written down, as well as the name of the company you&rsquo;re claiming against, the exact value of the transaction, and the date or dates on which these transactions took place.</p>\n<p>Any invoices or correspondence is helpful, too, and take some time to note down precisely why you believe the transaction to be fraudulent, or the company to be a scam, before getting in touch with your bank, so that you&rsquo;re ready to give details of this.</p>\n<h2>What Happens Next?</h2>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve made your claim, the bank will assess and process it; this stage may take some time. If it&rsquo;s deemed to be a legitimate claim, then you can expect to have the funds back in your account within one to three days, although this may vary by different banks.</p>\n<h2>How About If I Used Paypal?</h2>\n<p>Things may be a little trickier if you made the disputed transactions using your PayPal account. Paypal is usually considered to be a third party, so if you made the payments using funds that were already in your Paypal account, then your bank or card issuer will be unlikely to be able to help with a chargeback reversal.</p>\n<p>However, if your Paypal account was empty at the time you made the transaction &#8211; meaning that the money was debited straight from your linked bank account or payment card &#8211; then you have a case to claim a chargeback from your bank or card issuer.</p>\n<h2>Can I Get Help With My Chargeback Case?</h2>\n<p>For many people, finding the time to pursue a chargeback case on their own can be problematic &#8211; and trying to find a way through the system is often stressful, too. Often, those who have lost funds to a fraudulent broker or organization feel vulnerable, distressed, and not up to dealing with the pressures and potential obstacles in the way of seeking justice.</p>\n<h2>Effective Solutions to Help Complete Retrieval of Funds</h2>\n<p>If a hectic schedule puts you at risk of not being able to fight to get your funds back, or you&rsquo;d simply like expert support and guidance through the process to optimize your chance of a successful outcome, then get in touch with our team at <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/\">Payback</a> &#8211; we&rsquo;d love to hear from you.</p>\n",

All Forex trades are made through Forex broker platforms.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/e22f561eb3cc93b2b08eeae0edc0684e.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/e22f561eb3cc93b2b08eeae0edc0684e.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"447\"></picture></p>\n<p>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@snowjam?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">John McArthur</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/currency?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></p>\n<p>In order to make money, you might buy Euros at the price of $1.18 USD, then sell them when they are worth $1.21 USD, but there are many different ways to trade Forex. To find out more about Forex trading, such as how the different Forex markets work, <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/what-is-forex-trading-and-how-does-it-work/\">read this article</a>.</p>\n<p>Because of the high-risk nature of Forex trading, many people wonder &ldquo;is Forex a scam?&rdquo; Forex trading <em>is</em> legit, but the internet is full of <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/forex-scams/\">Forex scammers</a> who target new, usually naive, investors and steal large amounts of funds from them. These scammers usually pose as legit Forex brokers, but they are either completely fake or are using shady tactics to make money off their clients.</p>\n<h2>What To Look Out for When Spotting Forex Trading Scams</h2>\n<h3>A Return on Investment That Is Too Good To Be True</h3>\n<p>Most investment scammers lure their victims in by promising unrealistic returns on their investments.</p>\n<p>Consider that a realistic profit on Forex trades (for experienced investors) is somewhere in the range of 1-5% ROI. So, if any Forex broker offers you &ldquo;guaranteed&rdquo; returns that are much higher than this, they are very likely running a Forex scam.</p>\n<h3>Negative Reviews Online, No Certifications, and Illegitimate Proof of Success</h3>\n<p>Before you ever send money to a Forex broker, do thorough research about them to ensure they are the real deal. Start by typing the name of the company into Google, followed by the word &ldquo;reviews&rdquo; to pull up reviews from past clients. If you see any negative reviews, especially suggesting that the broker is involved in fraud, run the other way.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you should only work with certified, registered brokers in your local area. Many Forex scammers operate offshore from where you live, and are not properly licensed or regulated in any way in your home country.</p>\n<p>Finally, many scam brokers will try to gain your trust by showing you &ldquo;proof&rdquo; of their trading system&rsquo;s success. These might be screenshots, spreadsheets, client testimonials, or other types of data, but you have no way of knowing if what they&rsquo;re showing you is real. No matter how professional a broker&rsquo;s site looks, don&rsquo;t believe everything you see or read on it.</p>\n<h3>Pressure and Unreasonable Deadlines</h3>\n<p>Fraudulent Forex scam brokers also tend to use high-pressure sales tactics and aim to get you to make trades under tight deadlines in order to make themselves as much money as possible.</p>\n<p>Remember that, at the end of the day, any broker you work with is providing YOU with a service, so your trades should always be on your terms. Legit brokers make money on fees and commissions no matter what, so they shouldn&rsquo;t need to pressure you.</p>\n<h3>The Inability To Contact Anyone That Has Used Their Services Before</h3>\n<p>The most secure broker platforms to use are ones that you can obtain personal references for. If you don&rsquo;t know anyone who has used a certain Forex broker before, and you can&rsquo;t find any real information about them on forums or review sites, there&rsquo;s a higher chance that they could be scammers.</p>\n<h3>A Trading System That Costs More Than a Few Hundred Dollars</h3>\n<p>Most legit Forex brokerage platforms only charge a small monthly fee up front, and then charge commissions on all the trades you make. For example, they might charge you $12 a month, plus up to $5 per 100,000 currency units traded.</p>\n<p>If any broker is selling you a system that costs significantly more than this, like in the several hundreds of dollars a month in fees and commissions range, they are probably scamming you.</p>\n<h2>What Not To Expect From Forex in Order To Avoid a Forex Scam</h2>\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t Look for Quick and Large ROIs</h3>\n<p>Though Forex is legit, it is by no means a way to &ldquo;get rich quick.&rdquo; Forex trading takes a lot of time, dedication, and discipline in order to make steady returns over the long term. Anyone who claims they can quickly flip your money in the Forex markets and make you big returns is not telling you the truth.</p>\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t Expect Guaranteed Success</h3>\n<p>At least 70%, and probably closer to 90%, of people who trade in Forex lose money. That&rsquo;s just the reality of Forex trading, and the reason why many people wonder &ldquo;is Forex legit?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>However, if you commit the time and capital required to make good Forex trades, it <em>is</em> possible to earn strong ROIs over the long term. Just don&rsquo;t expect guaranteed or instant success, and don&rsquo;t believe anyone who tells you they can guarantee that you make money on Forex.</p>\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t Trust Someone You&rsquo;ve Never Spoken To, Who Is Offshore and Unregulated</h3>\n<p>As we touched on earlier, most fraudulent Forex brokers operate offshore and are not registered with the local governing bodies where their victims live. As such, they are able to run their scams in relative peace and make off with thousands of dollars from unsuspecting investors, which they funnel into offshore bank accounts.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re ever contacted online by a Forex broker or trading system salesperson, and they aren&rsquo;t located and regulated locally, don&rsquo;t look any further into trading with them. There are plenty of safe brokers you can use instead to avoid becoming the next victim of a Forex scam.</p>\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t Expect Facebook/Instagram Ads To Be Legitimate</h3>\n<p>One of the preferred ways Forex scammers attract targets is by running paid ads on social media sites, including Facebook and Instagram.</p>\n<p>These ads usually promise high ROIs and quick success, and are often linked to profiles of brokers or &ldquo;Forex influencers&rdquo; who make themselves appear very wealthy. They might claim to have some &ldquo;secret&rdquo; to Forex trading to try and entice you into signing up for their program, but they will really just steal your money.</p>\n<h2>Recovering From a Forex Scam (If You Didn&rsquo;t Spot the Signs Early On)</h2>\n<p>Even when you know how to spot a Forex scam, you can still fall victim to one. Fortunately, you may still be able to get your money back with the help of the fund recovery specialists at PayBack.</p>\n<p>Contact us as soon as you suspect you&rsquo;ve been scammed for the best odds of getting some or all of your money back from the Forex scammers.</p>\n",

However, binary options bot software is also one of the most common ways fraudulent options brokers scam their clients.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to get into binary options trading, it&rsquo;s important to know how to avoid getting scammed by a binary robot scam, and what to do in the unfortunate event that you <em>do </em>fall victim to such a scam.</p>\n<h2>What Is a Binary Options Robot?</h2>\n<p>A binary option trading robot is a type of software that allegedly uses pre-programmed algorithms to study the binary options markets and provide you with trading advice. Broker platforms claim that their bots advise you on how to make low-risk, high-return trades, but remember that many of these bots are just a type of <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/binary-options-scams/\">binary options scam</a>.</p>\n<h3>How Does a Binary Robot Work?</h3>\n<p>Binary options trading bots are available to purchase through certain binary options broker platforms, which are usually unlicensed and unregulated. In order to download and use the trading software, you typically have to pay a flat-fee and/or a monthly subscription fee.</p>\n<p>These bot platforms, also known as auto-trading software, help you perform your daily binary options trades using trading signals and algorithmic predictions of market patterns. In other words, the software watches and analyzes the binary options markets and provides you with profitable trades to make. You can either make these trades manually or have the bots trade for you automatically.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/93b35e64edaa103acb3a9e6c6f5cd489.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/93b35e64edaa103acb3a9e6c6f5cd489.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"328\"></picture></p>\n<p>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@jsnbrsc?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jason Briscoe</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/trading?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></p>\n<h2>Are All Options Trading Robots a Scam?</h2>\n<p>While the majority of binary options bots are scams, some of them <em>are</em> legitimate, and are offered by licensed and regulated brokerage platforms as free downloads or as part of a service package.</p>\n<p>The difference between scam bots and legit trading bots is that the legit ones are regularly updated and improved upon, so they can actually provide real trading analysis. On the other hand, trading bot software offered by fraudulent brokers is not continuously developed, as it is not intended to actually help you make profitable trades &mdash; it&rsquo;s just designed as a way to make money for the scammers through fees and commissions.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that, because of the high-risk nature of binary options trading, even legitimate trading bots are risky to use. While the low effort required on your part might be enticing, trading robots are not a way to &ldquo;get rich quick,&rdquo; and you can still end up losing a lot of money if you don&rsquo;t use them effectively.</p>\n<h3>Benefits of Using a Binary Robot That Isn&rsquo;t a Scam</h3>\n<p>Legitimate binary trading bot software allows you to set different trading criteria based on your trading style and risk tolerance. So, in theory, you can customize them to reduce the amount of work and analysis that you have to personally do in order to make good binary options trades.</p>\n<h4>Some of the other benefits of using a legit binary options robot are:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Make trades without your human emotions involved</li>\n<li>Save time and make automatic trades while you are busy</li>\n<li>Are inexpensive or free through legitimate options brokers</li>\n<li>Can be integrated with multiple broker platforms</li>\n<li>Make trades faster than any human can</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How To Avoid Binary Robot Scams</h2>\n<h3>Read Reviews About the Binary Option Robot</h3>\n<p>The first thing you should do when you&rsquo;re evaluating whether or not to use a particular binary option robot is look for reviews about the auto-trading software. There are lots of binary option robot review sites that rate various trading bots, which can help inform your decision. Many of these review sites also provide black lists of known binary bot scam brokers.</p>\n<h4>Some non-recommended and known scam broker sites to avoid include:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Banc de Binary</li>\n<li>Beeoptions</li>\n<li>com</li>\n<li>com</li>\n<li>Bull Option</li>\n<li>OptionRally</li>\n<li>Option-World</li>\n<li>Safe24Option</li>\n<li>TraderXP</li>\n<li>Vault Options</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t Be Pressured Into Quick Sales</h3>\n<p>One thing that all scam brokers have in common is that they lure their victims in with high-pressure sales tactics. They often reach out using cold calling or cold emailing, or encounter you via social media, and push their options trading software on you.</p>\n<p>Scammers may try to pressure you into signing up for a trading bot platform by saying there is some limited time offer that you&rsquo;re going to miss out on if you don&rsquo;t pay now. The key thing to remember here is that anyone who is pressuring you into signing up for trading software is likely a scammer &mdash; legitimate brokers do not need to use these kinds of tactics to get clients.</p>\n<p>Never, ever purchase a binary options trading bot without first doing your own investigation into the software to determine whether or not it is legitimate. If you can&rsquo;t find any positive reviews of a certain trading software platform, it&rsquo;s probably fake.</p>\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t Be Fooled By Fancy Images, Professional Statements, or High ROIs</h3>\n<p>Binary options robot scams also try to reel you in by making their software look highly professional and authentic. They might have things like screenshots and &ldquo;testimonials&rdquo; on their site to make their bots look like the real deal, but there really isn&rsquo;t any way to know what&rsquo;s real and what&rsquo;s not. So, don&rsquo;t let a polished, professional image trick you into thinking that any old trading bot is legitimate.</p>\n<p>Additionally, binary options brokers (and all scammers, for that matter) usually promise you high ROIs that are simply too good to be true. The reality is that binary options trading is a very difficult trading market to make high returns in, and only very experienced traders do well in it. So, never believe any promises about &ldquo;guaranteed&rdquo; high returns if you sign up for a certain bot service.</p>\n<h3>Think Twice Before Making a Decision</h3>\n<p>Finally, always think twice before committing to a particular binary option robot service. Even if there are good reviews and the site looks professional, it&rsquo;s impossible to guarantee that an options bot is high quality and will actually help you make good trades. So, make sure you&rsquo;re still willing to take a risk and know that you could still end up getting scammed by the bot. When in doubt, always go with your gut feeling &mdash; if something feels off, it probably is.</p>\n<h2>How To Recover From a Binary Robot Scam</h2>\n<p>If you are the unfortunate victim of a binary robot scam, don&rsquo;t despair.

This combination has resulted in a sort of &ldquo;Wild West&rdquo; environment where scammers can easily take advantage of new crypto enthusiasts who are eager to get involved and make money off crypto in different ways.</p>\n<p>As you may already know, Bitcoin is the most popular and most valuable cryptocurrency available on the market right now. As such, there are many different Bitcoin scams out there that you need to be aware of and know how to spot if you plan on investing in Bitcoin. One of the most common ways investors get scammed is through Bitcoin mining scams.</p>\n<h2>What Is a Bitcoin Mining Scam?</h2>\n<p>In order to generate new Bitcoin on the market, it has to be &ldquo;mined.&rdquo; Bitcoin mining is a complex process that involves a lot of hardware and computing power, which is used to validate crypto transactions on the blockchain. The actual science behind crypto mining is very hard for the average person to understand, which is a big part of why <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/cryptocurrency-scams/\">crypto scammers</a> are able to trick so many victims into falling for their Bitcoin mining scams.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/c282dcfb43db32fc16fb7ff8769ee5d1.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/c282dcfb43db32fc16fb7ff8769ee5d1.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"390\"></picture></p>\n<p>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@brianwangenheim?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Brian Wangenheim</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/bitcoin-mining?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></p>\n<h3>How Does a Bitcoin Mining Scam Work?</h3>\n<p>There are different types of Bitcoin mining scams that you should watch out for. For example, some scammers claim to own large crypto mining operations and will offer to &ldquo;rent&rdquo; you out a certain amount of hardware or computing power in order for you to generate your own Bitcoin profits.</p>\n<p>The fraudsters will try to get you to send them large sums of money in exchange for allegedly high returns on your investment, but they then just disappear with your funds. Or, the scammers send you a small sum of money back at first to gain your trust, but ask for even more funds from you in order to increase your returns.</p>\n<p>In some cases, crypto mining scams function like traditional pyramid schemes or Ponzi schemes. The fraudsters might send you some kind of minimal return on your investment, but pressure you into recruiting more people that you know into the &ldquo;mining operation&rdquo; in exchange for additional financial incentives, like cash bonuses. In reality, there is no Bitcoin mining going on in these pyramid schemes, and the scammers are just taking everyone&rsquo;s money and spreading small sums around to keep people believing in the scam and bringing more unsuspecting investors on board.</p>\n<h3>Are All Bitcoin Mining Investments a Scam?</h3>\n<p>In short, yes, in the sense that all Bitcoin mining investments are most likely going to result in you losing money. While there are indeed real crypto mining operations running, it takes incredibly large amounts of resources and money in order to actually make them profitable, and they are typically very secretive and private. Anyone claiming that you can make money off crypto mining by sending them a relatively small investment is most likely scamming you.</p>\n<h3>Are Bitcoin Mining Scams Common?</h3>\n<p>As cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, become more and more mainstream, there are an increasing number of cryptocurrency scams out there. Because of the abstract nature of the cryptocurrency market, especially crypto mining, criminals are able to easily create convincing scams out of thin air, duping their victims into sending them thousands of dollars and then eventually disappearing.</p>\n<h2>How To Spot a Bitcoin Mining Scammer</h2>\n<h3>You See a Bitcoin Mining Investment Opportunity Via Instagram Ads</h3>\n<p>One of scammers&rsquo; favorite ways to attract their victims is through sponsored Instagram posts. These posts often feature fake testimonials and advertise large guaranteed returns on Bitcoin mining investments. If you click on the posts and go to the profiles, they are commonly full of posts flaunting huge amounts of wealth, allegedly earned through investing in Bitcoin mining.</p>\n<p>For instance, you might see fake &ldquo;crypto influencers&rdquo; posing in front of luxury cars, flying in private jets, or flashing big wads of cash. Of course, this is all just a tactic to make you think that you could achieve the same lifestyle if you invest in their Bitcoin mining operation. Legitimate Bitcoin miners shouldn&rsquo;t need to seek out funds from random people via Instagram, so don&rsquo;t believe any Bitcoin mining ads you see on the platform.</p>\n<h3>You Are Approached Through Facebook</h3>\n<p>Another way Bitcoin mining scammers approach their targets is by reaching out through them via Facebook. You might be cold-contacted by someone who claims to have a great investment opportunity, who uses high-pressure sales tactics to get you to send them money without really thinking it through.</p>\n<p>For instance, the individual might say that all you need to do is send them a few hundred dollars, and they&rsquo;ll grow it for you in a short amount of time via Bitcoin mining. They might also pressure you into recruiting your friends and family into the Bitcoin scam, which is really just a pyramid scheme.</p>\n<h3>The ROIs Are Too Good To Be True</h3>\n<p>The biggest red flag for any type of investment scam is a promise about ROIs that sounds too good to be true. These scammers usually &ldquo;guarantee&rdquo; things like 50% returns on your investments in under a month, or make other outlandish claims that get you imagining what you could do with all that money.</p>\n<h3>There Are Many Hidden Fees</h3>\n<p>If you put money into one of the common Bitcoin mining investment scams out there, you will often be asked to pay additional fees in order to withdraw it again, which is another huge red flag. Any type of online investment should clearly lay out all fees beforehand. So, if you are asked to pay something that wasn&rsquo;t agreed upon ahead of time in order to get your ROI back, don&rsquo;t send the scammers any more of your hard-earned funds.</p>\n<h2>Recovering From a Bitcoin Mining Scam: All Is Not Lost</h2>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve fallen victim to one of the many Bitcoin mining scams on Instagram or another platform, you may still be able to get some or all of your funds back by working with the fund recovery specialists at PayBack Ltd.</p>\n<p>Our team of cyber crime and financial experts is here to review your case and implement the most effective methods in order to retrieve your stolen funds from the scammers. Contact PayBack Ltd today for the highest odds of getting your money back.</p>\n<h2>Bitcoin Mining Is Not a Good Investment, Period.</h2>\n<p>At the end of the day, Bitcoin mining investments are not a good investment, even if they are legitimate. For small investors who can&rsquo;t afford to get their own full crypto mining operations up and running, it&rsquo;s always going to be a better investment to just buy cryptocurrency and wait for it to grow in value (though this is still risky).</p>\n<p>If you have money to invest, and want to get into the Bitcoin market, buy the cryptocurrency through a reputable, secure crypto trading exchange platform instead of trying to invest in Bitcoin mining. And remember &mdash; don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact the fund recovery specialists at PayBack if you ever get hit with any type of cryptocurrency scam or other online investment scam.</p>\n",

But, the stock market is also rife with fraud and different types of stock trading scams. So, you should be aware of the risks and know how to avoid them in order to keep you and your funds safe from stock market scams.</p>\n<h2>How To Avoid Stock Trading Scams: The Signs To Be Aware Of</h2>\n<p>While there are many different types of stock trading scams, there are some warning signs to watch out for that many of them have in common.</p>\n<h3>Unregistered Brokers and Guaranteed Returns</h3>\n<p>One of the biggest red flags of a stock trading scam is that an unregistered broker is offering you guaranteed returns. These fraudulent brokers often operate penny stock scams, and try to get you to buy a bunch of cheap stocks in order to inflate the prices and make themselves and their shady clients money. This is what&rsquo;s known as a pump and dump scam.</p>\n<p>The reality is that there is no such thing as a guaranteed ROI in the stock market &mdash; there is always some level of risk. To avoid being scammed, always work with registered, reputable brokers. If you can get a personal reference from a friend or family member who has worked with the broker successfully, that&rsquo;s even better.</p>\n<h3>Pressure and No Pressure From the Scammers (Both Can Be a Scam!)</h3>\n<p>Stock scammers, such as fraudulent brokers, often pressure you into sending money right away by saying there is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that they don&rsquo;t want you to miss out on. One of the golden rules in stock trading is don&rsquo;t let your emotions guide your decisions. Always take your time to investigate and contemplate potential investments before you pull the trigger.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, some scammers play the long game and take a more patient approach to defrauding you of your hard-earned money. For example, a scam penny stock broker might spend weeks or months earning your trust on small trades, then try to convince you to make one big trade, which is the scam they&rsquo;ve been planning all along.</p>\n<h3>You Receive Unsolicited Offers (Most Likely a Pump and Dump Scam)</h3>\n<p>Always be suspicious of any type of unsolicited investment offer, especially if it&rsquo;s regarding a company you&rsquo;ve never heard of before. Scammers often artificially inflate the prices of fake shell companies by cold-selling their victims, then dump off all their shares at a huge profit. When they do this, your stocks will plummet and you&rsquo;ll lose big on the investment.</p>\n<h3>Everyone Seems To Be Buying It</h3>\n<p>One sales tactic that fraudulent brokers and paid stock promoters love to use is the &ldquo;everyone is buying it&rdquo; pitch. They&rsquo;ll claim that everyone is investing in a certain stock because it&#8217;s about to blow up and rise a ton in value, and that you should buy it too. Before investing in any stock, you should do your own research and determine whether or not you actually believe in the company and are interested in investing. Never give in to a fear of missing out on something just because other people are (allegedly) buying it.</p>\n<h3>Understand That Listings Are Not Reassurance Against Fraud</h3>\n<p>Just because a stock is listed on a big stock exchange, such as the NYSE or NASDAQ, doesn&rsquo;t mean that it can&rsquo;t be part of a stock trading scam. Be especially wary of stocks with low market cap values and low trading volumes, as these are the easiest for scammers to manipulate for their own benefit.</p>\n<h2>What To Do To Avoid Being Part of Stock Fraud</h2>\n<h3>Ask Questions</h3>\n<p>Scammers use high-pressure sales tactics because they don&rsquo;t want you to do your own research before investing. Always ask brokers for more information and independently verify any claims they make to ensure they are telling the truth. Also, ask yourself things like &ldquo;what does this person stand to gain from me investing in this opportunity?&rdquo; and &ldquo;why are they giving me this tip when I&rsquo;ve never contacted them?&rdquo;</p>\n<h3>Use Your Gut Instincts</h3>\n<p>If something feels off in terms of a stock trade, it probably is. So, when in doubt, trust your gut. For instance, if someone reaches out to you about a stock investment opportunity that sounds legit, but you are suspicious of the person or don&rsquo;t know why they are reaching out to <em>you</em> specifically, don&rsquo;t fall for their pitch.</p>\n<h3>Research and Read Reviews</h3>\n<p>If an individual broker or stock broker firm contacts you to try and gain your business, always look them up online to ensure they are legit. Look for reviews on Google or on reputable investment information sites to see what past clients have to say about them. Also, Google the company&rsquo;s or person&rsquo;s name, followed by keywords like &ldquo;scam&rdquo; and &ldquo;fraud&rdquo; to see if they have already been flagged for any type of shady behavior.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/bada2b17398a26099548a96c002d3daf.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/bada2b17398a26099548a96c002d3daf.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"390\"></picture></p>\n<p>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@adamaszczos?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Adam Nowakowski</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/stock-trading?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></p>\n<h3>Know and Trust the Person</h3>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re going to work with a stock broker, always make sure you know and trust them personally before trusting them with your money. Make sure they have the required licenses and qualifications to handle your money, ask them to provide you with reliable references, and get to know them to get a gut feeling about them before you start trading.</p>\n<p>Also, don&rsquo;t believe any sponsored ads you see on social media or elsewhere on the internet claiming that you can make high returns on investments. You have no way of knowing who the people behind these are, even if you start messaging with them online. It&rsquo;s best to work with brokers who have a physical office in your area, so you can meet in person whenever you want to.</p>\n<h3>Look Out for the Red Flags Above</h3>\n<p>Finally, look out for all the red flags of a stock trading scam that we mentioned above. To recap, these are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unregistered brokers</li>\n<li>Guaranteed returns (promises that are too good to be true)</li>\n<li>High-pressure sales tactics (&ldquo;once-in-a-lifetime&rdquo; opportunities)</li>\n<li>Low-pressure sales tactics (long-play stock market scams)</li>\n<li>Unsolicited offers (cold-contact from brokers and stock promoters)</li>\n<li>The &ldquo;everyone is buying it&rdquo; pitch</li>\n<li>Stocks that aren&rsquo;t on major listings (but even ones that are can be part of a scam)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What To Do If You&rsquo;ve Been Scammed by Stock Market Fraud</h2>\n<p>If you follow all of the above tips, you should be much safer investing in the stock market. However, many stock market scams are quite sophisticated, and anyone can become a victim.</p>\n<p>The scam recovery experts at PayBack have extensive experience dealing with stock market fraud and will do everything in their power to get your money back.

The better you understand what the stock market is and how it works, the more prepared you will be to avoid <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/stock-trading-scams/\">stock trading scams</a>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/b5d2b76c1c0df82b1deec3c87512235f.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/b5d2b76c1c0df82b1deec3c87512235f.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"389\"></picture></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What Is a Stock?</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>When a company goes public, they offer up a number of shares of ownership in the company to anyone who wants to invest in the company in order to raise capital to fund the company further. Companies also commonly promise shares to early investors in exchange for seed capital. These shares in a company are known as stocks, but can also be referred to as equities.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Stocks are assets that rise and fall in value based on a company&rsquo;s financial performance and other factors. Stock market traders aim to make investments based on predicted rises in market values in order to make a profit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Market Values</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>The market value of a stock is the current value at which a stock is being traded. In other words, it is what it costs to buy a specific stock at a certain time, or how much you make if you sell the stock.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Trading Volumes</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>The trading volume of a stock is a measure of how many shares or contracts of that particular stock are being traded during a certain time period. The most common time period for which trading volumes are measured is a trading day or the timeframe during which the stock market is open on a day.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Types of Stocks</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>There are many different types of stocks, but the most frequently traded are common and preferred stocks.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h4>Common</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>A common stock is the most basic type of stock issued by publicly traded companies and accounts for the vast majority of stocks available on the market. In business terms, a stock is equal to a vote on a company&rsquo;s board issues and other matters.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For instance, if a company has 100 shares on the market, and you own 5, you have a 5% share of that company and 5 votes on the board.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h4>Preferred</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>Preferred stocks are like common stocks, but with the added benefit for shareholders that they payout guaranteed dividends. For example, you might receive a %1.5 annual dividend of the total price of all the preferred shares you own in a company. Preferred stockholders also waive their voting rights in a company they own shares in.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>How Does the Stock Market Work: A Basic Understanding</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h3>What Is the Stock Market?</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>The stock market is where public companies issue shares for investors to buy and sell amongst themselves. In other words, when shares are bought and sold on a stock market, investors are actually buying them from or selling them to other investors, rather than dealing with a company directly.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>What Is Stock Market Volatility?</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Stock market volatility is the rate at which the prices of stocks increase or decrease over certain periods of time. More volatility means more risks, although the nature of the stock market means that there is always some level of volatility.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>How Does the Stock Market Price Work?</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>In general terms, stock market prices are driven by supply and demand &mdash; the more demand there is for a stock, the higher its price is, and vice versa. Supply and demand can be affected by many different factors.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For example, if a company announces a successful fiscal quarter and large profits, there may be a rush of investors looking to buy the stock because they see great future potential for the company. This in turn drives up the price of the stock.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>How Do Companies Make Money From Stocks?</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>When a privately-held company decides to go public, they hold an IPO or an initial public offering. When this happens, the company offers up a predetermined number of shares in the business, which are typically backed by banks who arrange for them to be sold on stock exchanges.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In return for offering up shares for sale to public investors, the company receives capital, which they can then reinvest into the business. Periodically, companies will release more stocks onto public stock exchanges to raise more capital as needed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>What Is a Stock Exchange?</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Stock exchanges are individual markets on which stocks are bought and sold. There are many major stock exchanges throughout the world, a few of the most active and well-known being the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the London Stock Exchange (LSE), and the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h4>Over-the-Counter Exchanges</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>Over-the-counter stock exchanges are smaller markets where stocks are traded for companies that may not meet the requirements to be listed on the big markets, such as the NYSE. Stocks traded OTC are typically bought and sold via broker and dealer networks.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Trading on over-the-counter exchanges is riskier than trading on the big stock exchanges because they are not as governed and regulated.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/7b7a8c3a25f381aa587b372a3de0e441.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/7b7a8c3a25f381aa587b372a3de0e441.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"389\"></picture></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Why Do Companies Issue Shares?</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Raising Capital</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>As we mentioned above, the main reason that companies issue shares is to raise capital. While early-stage companies can often raise money through private investments, many companies eventually reach a point where they need larger sums of money to continue growing. This is when a business may decide to sell shares in itself on public stock exchanges to raise more capital.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Listing Shares</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>When a company reaches a point where they cannot raise enough money by issuing more shares and/or getting more private investments, they can go public and start offering their shares on public stock exchanges through an IPO. This process is known as listing shares. When a company goes public and lists its shares, this is when early-stage investors have the option to sell shares they may have received in return for their earlier investments.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>How Does Investing in Stocks Work?</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>In order to actually invest in stocks, you must trade them through a stock trading platform or broker. Traditionally, this was done over the phone or in person, but now there are many online and mobile platforms that make investing in stocks easier than ever.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>What Happens When You Buy a Stock?</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>When you buy a stock, you become a shareholder in the company of that stock. Depending on the type of stock you buy, this gives you certain rights within that company, such as the right to vote on corporate decisions or the right to receive dividend payouts from the business.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Once you own a stock, you also own an asset that changes in value, the same as owning a property or any other physical asset. The difference is that a stock is not something you can touch or see. Stock trading platforms keep track of all the stocks you own and show you their current value to help you make decisions about buying and selling them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>What Happens When You Sell a Stock?</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>When you sell a stock, you receive a sum of money equal to the market value of the stock at the time you choose to sell it. Ideally, you want to make a profit by selling stocks, although there are some cases in which you might decide to sell stocks that are plummeting in value to avoid even further losses. If you sell all your stocks in a company, you are no longer a shareholder of that business, and thus do not have any shareholder rights.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Stock Trading vs. Options Trading: What&rsquo;s the Difference?</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Whereas stocks represent individual shares in a company, options are contracts with other investors in which you bet on which direction a stock&rsquo;s price will go in, how high or low it will go from its current price and the timeframe in which all that will happen.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Options trading is much more complex than stock trading, and thus presents more risks, especially for beginners.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Risks With Investing in Stocks: Getting Scammed on Stock Exchanges</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Though stock exchanges and stock market trading are regulated and theoretically safe to do (as long as you&rsquo;re OK with the risk of stocks losing value), there are various stock market scams out there to be aware of.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For example, some companies or individuals spread false information in an effort to artificially inflate stock prices, then sell off all their shares for a profit. This causes the price to drop back down again and new investors typically lose money.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There are also fraudulent investment advisers and brokers out there who charge you fees for bad investment advice, so you lose money both to them and on poor investment decisions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These are just a couple of examples of the many ways scammers take advantage of stock market investors. In order to avoid stock market scams, there are two general golden rules to follow:</p>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Always independently verify any information by checking it with a reputable source. This goes for both information about a company or advice from an investment adviser or broker.</li>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t believe anything that sounds too good to be true, because it probably is. The stock market is not a place to &ldquo;get rich quick,&rdquo; and anyone claiming they can tell you how to do so is probably lying.</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<h2>If You Are Scammed on Stock Exchanges, Get Your Money Back With PayBack</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/\">PayBack</a> are experts in getting money back from stock exchange scams.

The potential to make a lot of money in a short amount of time is what attracts so many traders to the market.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Every currency is traded in pairs on the forex market. For example, the pair EUR/USD is the pair for trading the Euro against the US dollar.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As values of different global currencies rise and fall throughout the day, there are opportunities to make profits by trading one currency for another.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>What&rsquo;s the Difference Between Day Trading and Forex Trading?</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the sense that both day traders and forex traders aim to make consistent profits by buying and selling their assets throughout the day as opposed to buying assets and holding them long term, day trading, and forex trading are similar.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The key difference between day trading and forex trading is what is being traded. Day traders can buy and sell a variety of commodities and stocks, whereas foreign exchange market traders only trade in global currencies.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>What Are Forex Trading Hours?</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>The forex market is controlled by a global network of banks, located in major commerce hubs including London, New York, Sydney, and Tokyo. This means that, unlike specific stock markets, the foreign exchange market never closes during the week &mdash; it is accessible 24/7 from Monday to Friday.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>What Is Forex Options Trading?</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>A forex option gives a trader the right to buy or sell a currency at a certain price on or before a certain date and time, without obligating them to do so. Buyers must agree on the prices and the dates and times with sellers and sign an options contract.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What Is a Currency Market and How Do They Work?</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Currency markets have been around for as long as humans have been using currencies to buy goods and services.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever traveled and exchanged your local currency for a foreign currency, you&rsquo;ve participated in a simple version of the foreign exchange market, albeit for practical purposes instead of in order to make a profit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In forex trading, there are three main markets that traders participate in to try and earn profits:</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Spot Forex Market</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>The spot forex market gets its name from the phrase &ldquo;on the spot.&rdquo; When you trade on the spot forex market, you are trading one currency for another right then and there at the current values.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Forward Forex Market</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the forward forex market, parties agree to buy and sell a certain amount of currency at a specified price at some point in the future. This point may either be on a specific date or within a date range.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Future Forex Market</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Future forex market trading is similar to forward forex market trading, with agreements made about buying and selling set quantities of currencies at a certain date in the future. The main difference is that the future forex market utilizes legally binding contracts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What Is a Base and Quote Currency?</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>The base currency in a forex trade is the first currency listed and is the currency you are buying when you make a trade. The quote currency is the second currency listed and is the currency you are selling. Every global currency is represented by a three-letter code.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Example of Base and Quote Currency</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the example USD/CAD, USD stands for US dollar and is the base. CAD stands for the Canadian dollar and is the quote. If the base/quote pair USD/CAD is trading at $1.28, it means that buying $1 USD costs you $1.28 CAD.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/34b00b2ac646c53ce3c0ee0ca9bd3c13.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/34b00b2ac646c53ce3c0ee0ca9bd3c13.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"780\"></picture></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What Categories Do Most Forex Trading Providers Use?</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>With so many countries, many of which use their own unique currencies, you can imagine how many unique base and quote currency pairs it&rsquo;s possible to trade on the foreign exchange market.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That being said, there are four main currency pair categories that forex traders usually trade-in through brokers:</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Major Pairs</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>There are seven major pairs that account for approximately 80% of forex trades made around the world. All major forex pairs include the US dollar. Examples of major pairs are EUR/USD, USD/CAD, AUD/USD, and USD/JPY.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Minor Pairs</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Minor pairs are less frequently traded than major pairs and don&rsquo;t necessarily include the US dollar in all pairs. Examples of minor pairs in forex trading include GBP/JPY, EUR/GBP, and EUR/JPY.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Exotics</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Exotics forex trading pairs up major global currencies with smaller currencies. For example, they might match USD with currency from smaller European countries that have currency other than the Euro, such as Denmark (DKK) or Norway (NOK).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Regional Pairs</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Regional forex pairs are currencies paired up for two countries in the same region. For instance, Australia (AUD) and New Zealand (NZD) in Oceania or Norway (NOK) and Sweden (SEK) in Scandinavia.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>How Does Forex Trading Work?</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h3>What Is the Spread in Forex Trading?</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>The spread is the difference between the buy and sell prices for any given forex pair. The bigger the spread, the more potential you have to make money from trading a certain forex pair.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>What Is a Lot in Forex?</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>A lot is simply a standard-sized batch of currency units. Lots can be as small as 100, but standard lot sizes are 100,000. The bigger the lot traded, the higher the profits can be.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>What Is Leverage in Forex?</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Leverage is when traders borrow capital to make bigger forex trades. Many forex traders don&rsquo;t have the capital to buy a standard-sized lot of 100,000 currency units, so they borrow in order to make larger trades and, hopefully, greater profits.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>What Is Margin in Forex?</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Margin is a sum of money set aside in a forex trading account to cover financial obligations to brokers in the event that a trade doesn&rsquo;t go well for you. Different brokers require you to maintain different margin balances in order to trade with them.</p>\n<h3>What Is a Pip in Forex?</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>A pip is a single-digit movement in the fourth digit of a currency&rsquo;s price on the forex market. So, if the value of USD/CAD moved from $1.28561 to $1.28571, it went up one pip.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>What Is Swap in Forex?</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>A swap is an agreement to exchange foreign currency between two parties, typically with the goal of securing loans at a better interest rate than if you were to borrow directly from a foreign market.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>What Is Swing in Forex?</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Swing trading is when you perform forex trades that last a few days or longer to profit from an anticipated price change for a given currency. Since many forex trades can last as little as a few minutes, swing forex trading is considered mid-term trading, as opposed to short-term trading.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>What Is Copy in Forex?</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Copy-trading in forex is when you use some type of software to replicate the trades of other traders in real time, hoping to copy their success.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What Is the Best Forex Trading Platform?</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>There is no single best forex trading platform for beginners since trading on the foreign exchange market is not centralized. However, there are bad forex trading brokers, which are often unregulated and operate different scams and different types of fraud.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to make sure you always trade forex through a broker platform that&rsquo;s regulated in the country you&rsquo;re trading in. Every country has its own governing bodies for forex trading platforms, so do your research to find out what local regulations are and choose a reputable broker accordingly to protect yourself from forex scams.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>How Do I Protect Myself From Forex Trading Scams?</h3>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check the licenses and regulations of any brokers you&rsquo;re considering trading through</li>\n<li>Watch out for pyramid schemes, which involve you paying for forex trading &ldquo;advice&rdquo; or &ldquo;training&rdquo; and emphasize you recruiting more people into the program</li>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t use forex trading bots or robotic software that allegedly helps you make good trades</li>\n<li>Be wary of any trading advice or promise that sounds too good to be true, i.e. &ldquo;get rich quick&rdquo; scams</li>\n<li>Avoid forex brokers that don&rsquo;t have contact information or background info</li>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t trust unsolicited marketing related to forex trading</li>\n<li>Do your research about any forex trading platform before using it to determine how trustworthy it is</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<h3>If You Are Scammed By A Forex Trading Scam, Get Your Money Back With PayBack</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>PayBack are experts in getting money back from forex trading scams.

However, it is also very volatile and risky, and some people will even tell you that the stock market is rigged against small investors.</p>\n<p>That being said, it&rsquo;s quite possible to make good returns on your investments in the stock market &mdash; as long as you know what some of the problems you might run into are and follow some general stock investing tips. You also have to be aware of the risk of stock market scams, of which there are many.</p>\n<h2>Is the Stock Market Rigged?</h2>\n<h3>Nearly 50% of Americans Say the Stock Market Is Rigged Against Individual Investors</h3>\n<p>That&rsquo;s right &mdash; <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/most-investors-say-stock-market-rigged-2713838b-1d29-43c5-9dc9-37dd4e466702.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">almost half of the population of the United States believes the stock market is rigged in favor of large investment firms.</a></p>\n<p>This can be partly attributed to the widening wealth inequality in the US, which especially affects young people, who have much less faith in the stock market than older generations.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that the people surveyed were mainly independent investors, not investment professionals. Individuals with a college degree were more likely to agree that the stock market is rigged against small investors.</p>\n<h4>Key stats from survey regarding stock market rigging:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>48% of American citizens believe the stock market is rigged against individual investors</li>\n<li>13% of those surveyed disagreed that the stock market is rigged, with 5% strongly disagreeing</li>\n<li>58% of individuals with a college degree thought the stock market is rigged</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Difficulties That Small Investors May Come Across</h3>\n<h4>Information Asymmetry and Lack of Expertise</h4>\n<p>One reason why the stock market is probably rigged against small investors is because of the lack of access to professional expertise and information, such as technical analyses of the markets.<br />\nLarge investment firms and professional asset managers are able to make successful trades because they have access to advanced automated trading systems and because they are skilled in analyzing stock market data.</p>\n<p>Professional investors also often have access to inside information. Although it is illegal and unethical, insider trading is commonplace and is a form of stock market corruption.</p>\n<p>The internet has made it easier for individual investors to access stock market data and analyses, but there is still a lack of expertise and a lack of access to professional research that makes it harder for individual traders to get ahead.</p>\n<h4>Little Access To Capital and Pricing Power</h4>\n<p>Another reason that the stock market can feel rigged against small investors is that they have limited access to capital. This also means that they generally have less negotiating power when it comes to pricing for fees and commissions. The smaller a trade is, the higher a percentage you end up losing on such fees.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, large investment companies have access to millions of dollars with which to invest and make huge returns on. Because of how large the sums of money they move are, they can also get big breaks on fees and commissions from trading platforms and brokers.</p>\n<h4>Lack of Political Influence</h4>\n<p>Big financial firms have significant political influence, which can be used to manipulate markets and laws in their favor. Little investors typically don&rsquo;t have any such influence, and thus they are at the mercy of the markets and the laws governing them.</p>\n<h4>Few Mitigation Strategies</h4>\n<p>Mitigation strategies are ways to cut losses and avoid losing everything because of stock market volatility. Professional asset managers and investment companies have many mitigation strategies, and can afford to lose on some trades because they win on so many others.</p>\n<p>Individual investors don&rsquo;t have access to the same amount of mitigation strategies as professional investors do, so it&rsquo;s much easier to lose everything because of a bad investment decision.</p>\n<h2>Tips for Successful Investing</h2>\n<h3>Think Long Term</h3>\n<p>Unless you&rsquo;re trying to make investing in the stock market a source of regular income, you should be investing for the long term. This means spreading your funds out over multiple different assets and holding on to them for years until you need to access the money for retirement or another purpose.</p>\n<p>As long as your portfolio is diverse enough, this strategy should in theory produce decent annual returns of 10% or more.</p>\n<h3>Invest Passively</h3>\n<p>Investing passively is part of long-term investing and means that you are minimizing how much you&rsquo;re buying and selling. Instead of buying stocks, watching them constantly, and selling them as soon as they hit a certain high price, you buy a few different stocks and just sit on them for a long time until you&rsquo;re ready to sell.</p>\n<p>One of the best assets you can passively invest in is an index fund or an ETF. These are basically like pre-diversified portfolios that contain different percentages of well-performing stocks. They do not provide instant high returns, but the way that they are built ensures that their value gradually increases over time.</p>\n<h3>Have an Emergency Fund Available</h3>\n<p>You should never invest so much money that you don&rsquo;t have enough in savings for emergencies. When investing, you always run the risk of losing, and you never want to put yourself in the position of not having enough money when you&rsquo;re in a tight spot.</p>\n<p>Experts recommend that you set aside 3-6 months worth of living expenses as an emergency fund, preferably in a high-yield savings account that will earn you some interest on the money. Then, should you lose your job or need to pay for something unexpected, like unforeseen medical bills, you can use this money for it.</p>\n<h3>Check Your Broker To Avoid Stock Trading Scams</h3>\n<p>One of the most common ways to get scammed on stock trading is by trading through a fraudulent stock broker. Shady stock brokers run various types of scams, including manipulating stock prices or taking under-the-table payments from companies to push individuals to buy or sell their stocks.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/ce91fa3d44dcb1a4e0508b98fc6e9695.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/ce91fa3d44dcb1a4e0508b98fc6e9695.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"389\"></picture></p>\n<p>To avoid a stock broker scam, always check their background and read reviews and opinions on them from past clients. You can also Google their name along with keywords like &ldquo;scam&rdquo; and &ldquo;complaint&rdquo; to see whether they have already been reported or flagged for unethical or fraudulent behavior.</p>\n<h3>Read Financial Websites</h3>\n<p>Despite all the challenges independent investors face, there has never been a better time for individuals to get involved in the stock market. This is because there is so much free information on the internet that can help you decide what to invest in and minimize the risks of investing in stocks.</p>\n<p>To help you make good investment decisions, set apart 1 hour a week and spend it reading financial news, stock investment advice websites, and financial research reports and analyses. With time, you&rsquo;ll start to get the hang of interpreting information and using it to help you make good returns on your investments.</p>\n<h2>How To Get Your Money Back From a Stock Trading Scam</h2>\n<p>If you are scammed on a stock trade, you may still be able to get your money back with the help of the <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/\">fund recovery specialists at PayBack Ltd</a>.</p>\n<p>Our team of financial professionals and cybercrime experts deals with all types of online investment scams, including stock market rigging and fraudulent stock broker scams.

            "content": "<p>If you’re in the market for a new or used vehicle, one online listing site you may be looking at is eBay Motors. If so, you should be aware of the existence of eBay Motors scams and know how to spot them to avoid losing thousands of dollars.</p>\n<picture><source srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/f3c208cc49559b8d867746d33e53f808.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/f3c208cc49559b8d867746d33e53f808.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"389\"></picture>\n<h2>What Is an eBay Motors Scam?</h2>\n<p>eBay Motors is a subsection of eBay for buying and selling new and used vehicles and auto parts. Unfortunately, wherever large sums of money are involved, there are scammers, and eBay Motors is no exception. Scammers post fake car-for-sale ads on the site to try and trick victims into paying for a car that they will never actually receive.</p>\n<h3>How Does an eBay Motors Scam Work?</h3>\n<p>In an eBay Motors scam the scammers post a car for sale on eBay and make false promises related to the sale. Most commonly, the fraudsters will offer you an eBay protection plan and try to get you to send them money in advance via an unapproved payment method, before you even see the car in person. Then, they simply disappear with your money and you never get to see the car, let alone receive it. This type of eBay Motors scam is also known as an eBay Buyers Protection Program scam.</p>\n<h3>Is the eBay Buyers Motor Protection a Scam in and of Itself?</h3>\n<p>eBay Buyers Motor Protection is a vehicle purchase protection coverage offered by eBay to protect against certain losses associated with vehicle sale fraud. The coverage is legit, but it can only be provided directly by eBay, and no independent seller has the authority to offer you the eBay Motors Buyer Protection Program themselves. For legitimate sales conducted through eBay Motors, eBay covers up to $100,000 through its Vehicle Protection Program.</p>\n<h3>eBay Motors IS a Legit Site, But Scams Still Exist</h3>\n<p>eBay Motors is a legitimate site for buying a new vehicle, and you can definitely find some great deals on the site. However, it’s important to be aware of the risks and know how to spot an eBay Motors scam to protect yourself.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that eBay does not sell cars for people, and that it is just a platform for facilitating sales between independent parties. As such, eBay is not responsible for listings, and there is always a possibility that a for-sale listing is fake. Scammers steal photos and information from real new or used car ads and upload them to eBay Motors to make the fake listings look very believable.</p>\n<p>The fraudsters will communicate back and forth with you, answering questions you have and gaining your trust, but they typically won’t show you the car — because they don’t actually have it. In recent times, scammers have been known to use the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to not show interested buyers a vehicle in person</p>\n<h2>How To Spot an eBay Car Sales Scam</h2>\n<h3>The Payment Method Is in eBay Gift Cards or Via Another Dodgy Payment Form</h3>\n<p>Scammers often ask for payment in eBay gift cards or another alternative payment form, such as cryptocurrency. They prefer these types of payments for eBay vehicle scams because they are untraceable. If you’re interested in a vehicle on eBay motors and the sellers ask you for one of these sketchy, unapproved eBay motors payment methods, it’s a red flag.</p>\n<h3>The Vehicle Price Is Very, Very Low</h3>\n<p>If the price of a car on eBay seems too good to be true, it probably is. eBay motors scammers use low vehicle prices to lure their victims in, who think they are going to get an amazing deal on a vehicle. You can look up a car’s Blue Book value to get an idea of how much the vehicle you’re interested in should cost. If the listing price on eBay Motors is significantly lower, it could very well be a fake eBay Motors listing.</p>\n<h3>They Guarantee You Are Under the eBay Buyers Protection From the First Round of Negotiations</h3>\n<p>As we touched on earlier, fraudsters try to trick you into a false sense of security by claiming that you are covered against any type of scam by the eBay Buyers Protection Program. Remember that this fraud protection can only be given by eBay itself, and not by individual sellers.</p>\n<h3>The Reviews Online Are a Giveaway</h3>\n<p>Always type the name of a seller into Google and add the keyword “review” to pull up reviews or complaints from past customers. If there are any bad reviews of the seller, this is a dead giveaway that they are fraudsters and you shouldn’t proceed to do business with them.</p>\n<h3>You Are Unable To Inspect the Car Before</h3>\n<p>Scammers often pull images from real vehicle-for-sale ads and use them to run an eBay Motors scam. Since they aren’t really in possession of the car they are “selling,” they won’t let you inspect the car in person before you pay for it. Real sellers will make the effort to let you see a car in person in order to close the deal.</p>\n<h3>Their Emails Are Not Sent From the Official eBay Domain</h3>\n<p>All communications via eBay Motors should go through the eBay platform itself, and thus emails should have the official eBay domain on them. If a seller is sending you emails from another address, it could be a sign that they are trying to hide their actions and are conducting eBay car sales scams. Emails from scammers may also contain many spelling errors and grammatical mistakes or use overly formal, awkward sounding language.</p>\n<h2>Tips for Buying a Car Safely Online, To Avoid Being Scammed</h2>\n<h3>Don’t Send Payments Through Wire Transfers or Gift Cards</h3>\n<p>To avoid getting scammed out of thousands of dollars on eBay motors, never send a payment for a vehicle via wire transfers or gift cards. Stick to secure in-person payment methods, such as cash, a cashier’s check, or a personal check. Make sure that you can drive the car away after making a payment to avoid getting scammed.</p>\n<picture><source srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/21fff8da3b2fe3334c2e54fd133d6d72.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/21fff8da3b2fe3334c2e54fd133d6d72.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"389\"></picture>\n<h3>Check the Background of the Seller</h3>\n<p>Do your research by Googling a seller’s name and add keywords like “scam” or “complaint” to see if they have been flagged for fraud or have some kind of criminal record. You can also check their profiles on social media to make sure they are a real person. If you find anything that looks sketchy, or if it seems like they’re using a fake name, don’t do business with the seller.</p>\n<h3>Always Inspect the Car in Person and Check Its History Report</h3>\n<p>Never pay for a vehicle that you haven’t seen in person. You should always be able to see a car and test it out to make sure everything is in working order before you agree to purchase the vehicle. Ideally, you should inspect a vehicle with a reputable mechanic or someone who is knowledgeable about such things in order to ensure you are getting what’s advertised. During your inspection, make sure that the vehicle&#8217;s VIN number matches its history report and all of its legal documents.</p>\n<h2>What To Do If You’ve Been Scammed On eBay Motors</h2>\n<p>If you’ve fallen victim to an eBay motors scam, or any of the other <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/ebay-seller-scams/\">types of eBay scams</a> out there, the fund recovery specialists at <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/\">PayBack Ltd can help you get</a> your money back.

While Bitcoin is still the most popular cryptocurrency, there are other valuable cryptocurrencies that can present good investment opportunities.</p>\n<p>Since crypto is still a very high-risk investment, investing in one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies on this list is a safer choice than putting your money into newer, less established crypto companies.</p>\n<p>In fact, there are many fake cryptocurrencies and many different types of crypto scams out there, so it&rsquo;s very important to do your research and ensure the crypto product you choose to invest in is legitimate.</p>\n<h2>What Are the Top 10 Cryptocurrencies?</h2>\n<p>The cryptocurrency market is still considered the &ldquo;Wild West&rdquo; of investing, but there are some well-known cryptocurrency assets that have risen out of the dust and can be treated as legitimate (though volatile) investments.</p>\n<p>You can buy any of the most popular cryptocurrency assets via reputable crypto exchanges, though there is always a risk associated with crypto transactions, since they are still unregulated in most countries.</p>\n<h3>1. Bitcoin (BTC)</h3>\n<p>As we already mentioned, Bitcoin was the world&rsquo;s first cryptocurrency, and it is still the most valuable cryptocurrency you can buy.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s unclear who exactly created Bitcoin, but it was allegedly a Japanese man named Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin launched in 2009, but it wasn&rsquo;t until 2017 that the cryptocurrency became a more widely accepted investment.</p>\n<p>Due to a surge in Bitcoin&rsquo;s price in 2017, during which 1 coin of the crypto asset reached a value of about $20,000, the general public became more aware of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency as a whole. In the years since, Bitcoin and other types of cryptocurrencies have become an increasingly common investment, especially for new, typically younger investors.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Price: $40,330.90</li>\n<li>Market Cap: $763.848B</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Ethereum (ETH)</h3>\n<p>When we talk about the most important cryptocurrencies, Ethereum is a close second to Bitcoin on the list. Ethereum is the second most popular cryptocurrency in the global crypto market and was the first crypto company to launch smart contracts.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/eede756b6cf1282776644a28497ffbd7.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/eede756b6cf1282776644a28497ffbd7.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"388\"></picture></p>\n<p>Smart contracts are computer programs stored on the blockchain that allow Ethereum to convert traditional contracts into digital parallels. These contracts allow users to conduct secure business transactions using Ethereum, without the need for any intermediaries.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Price: $3044.74</li>\n<li>Market Cap: $369,506,396,690.32</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3. Tether (USDT)</h3>\n<p>Tether is a type of cryptocurrency that&rsquo;s known as a &ldquo;stablecoin.&rdquo; This means that its price is anchored, in this case at one dollar. In other words, Tether&rsquo;s value is linked directly to the value of the US dollar.</p>\n<p>Tether is essentially just a digital form of the US dollar, which is often used by traders to move money from one crypto asset to another (instead of converting an asset into actual dollars and back into crypto again).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Price: $1.00</li>\n<li>Market Cap: $82,587,984,162.92</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>4. Binance Coin (BNB)</h3>\n<p>Binance coin is a cryptocurrency issued by Binance, one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. It was originally intended to function as a token that Binance users could use to pay for transaction fees, but it has since evolved into a cryptocurrency that can be used for various payments, including for buying different goods and services.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Price: $409.87</li>\n<li>Market Cap: $1.99T</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>5. USD Coin (USDC)</h3>\n<p>USD Coin is similar to Tether, in that its value is directly tied to the value of the US dollar. The coin is managed by a firm called Centre and is allegedly backed by fully reserved assets (real USD).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Price: $1.00</li>\n<li>Market Cap: $51B</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>6. XRP (XRP)</h3>\n<p>XRP, formerly known as Ripple, is a cryptocurrency that allows users to make cross-border, trust-less digital payments. It can facilitate exchanges for global fiat currencies, other cryptocurrencies, and even commodities, including gold.</p>\n<p>XRP is intended to be a digital alternative to the international SWIFT system for banks, allowing global financial institutions to make transactions with each other from any country. Regular users can also use XRP strictly as a crypto investment, as it is another of the largest cryptocurrencies in the world.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Price: $0.7117</li>\n<li>Market Cap: $33.902B</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>7. Terra (LUNA)</h3>\n<p>Terra is a platform that backs stablecoins with real global currencies, such as the USD and the EUR.

To find out more about getting your money back after being scammed, <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/contact-us/\">get in touch with one of our experts</a> for a free consultation.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/edc45c5380c1397787645addb92fdf4b.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/edc45c5380c1397787645addb92fdf4b.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"438\"></picture></p>\n<p>Binary options have become increasingly popular as a high-risk, high-reward type of trading. Since there are many different types of binary options trading, it&rsquo;s important to understand what the types of trades you can choose from are before you start investing in binary options. The better you understand different types of trading, the less likely you are to get scammed on a trade.</p>\n<h3>7 Most Common Types Of Binary Options Trades</h3>\n<h4>High/Low</h4>\n<p>One of the most common types of binary options trades is known as a high/low options trade. This is also one of the most simple types of trades for novice binary options traders to understand and execute successfully.</p>\n<p>In a high/low trade, you look at an asset and decide whether it will be higher or lower than the current price at a specific expiry time. The expiry time typically ranges from a few minutes to a few hours away. Most binary options trade expiry times are on the same day.</p>\n<p>If you think the asset will be at a higher price at the specified time, you pick &ldquo;high&rdquo; for your trade. If you think it  will be at a lower price, you pick &ldquo;low.&rdquo; If you are correct, you usually make somewhere between a 60% to a 90% return on your initial deposit. If you are wrong, you earn nothing.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/2a13f5bff324f380f09963447886704e.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/2a13f5bff324f380f09963447886704e.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"468\"></picture></p>\n<h3>One Touch/No Touch</h3>\n<p>One touch/no touch binary options trades are a little different than high/low trades. In this type of binary options trade, you bet on whether the price of an asset will reach or not reach a certain price point before the time of expiry. The risk is higher for one touch/no touch trades, but the potential return on investment can be as high as 300% if you are right.</p>\n<h3>Boundary/Range</h3>\n<p>Boundary options or range options is a type of binary options trading in which you bet on whether the price of a certain asset will stay within a certain range or go outside of the range before the trade reaches its expiry time.</p>\n<p>Compared to high/low trades and one touch/no touch trades, boundary/range trades can be less risky, especially if you&rsquo;re trading in assets that don&rsquo;t typically experience big price swings. They also offer around 100% returns if you win, making them a potentially more rewarding binary options trade than high/low trades.</p>\n<h3>60 Seconds/Short Term</h3>\n<p>Short term binary options trades are a niche type of binary options trading which occurs over very short periods of time. These types of trades are often just 60 seconds long, which is why they are also known as 60 seconds binary options trades.</p>\n<p>Short term binary options trades are usually high/low or one touch/no touch trades. However, since the trading period is so short, this type of trading is much more risky than other types of high/low or one touch/no touch trading.</p>\n<h3>Long Term</h3>\n<p>Long term binary options trades are the opposite of 60 seconds trades. In these trades, the trading period is often several days, weeks, or even a month long. These longer trading times make it easier to predict the price movement of an asset, as long as you have some trading experience and knowledge of the market.</p>\n<p>Because of this, long term binary options trades are popular among more veteran traders. However, long term trading is not as popular among brokers and new traders, who prefer faster action and quicker returns.</p>\n<h3>Ladder</h3>\n<p>Ladder trades are one of the most complicated types of binary options trades. In these types of trades, there are multiple expiry times and prices during the trading period, and you have to bet whether or not an asset will reach these different points along the &ldquo;ladder&rdquo; at certain times.</p>\n<p>Every time you are right about an asset hitting a price at a specific expiry time, you receive a partial payout. If you are consistently right, you can earn well over a 100% return on your investment. But, since you&rsquo;re betting on so many different things at once, it&rsquo;s much easier to be wrong. Ladder trading can be rewarding, but it takes time to learn how to do it effectively.</p>\n<h3>Pairs</h3>\n<p>Pairs trading differs from other types of binary options trading because you are looking at two assets instead of one for each trade. In pairs trading, you bet on the relative performance of one asset vs another. In other words, you have to decide which of the two assets will be performing better than the other at the trade&rsquo;s expiry time.</p>\n<p>Note that it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether the assets&rsquo; prices go up or down during the trade period in order for you to win this type of binary options trade. The only thing that matters is that you&rsquo;re right about how one asset performs compared to the other.</p>\n<h3>Which Type of Binary Options Trade Is the Best for Me?</h3>\n<p>In order to choose the best type of binary options trading for you, the first step is to make sure you understand how all the different types of trades work. This will allow you to determine which type of trading you are most confident betting on an asset&rsquo;s performance with.</p>\n<p>For example, you might want to start out with simple high/low binary options trading. As you get the hang of it, you can try to learn more complex forms of binary options trading.</p>\n<p>No matter what type of binary options trading you decide to execute, you should always choose a regulated binary options broker to make your trades through. This will help ensure that you don&rsquo;t get scammed by a fraudulent broker, of which there are many.</p>\n<p>As long as you follow this advice, you should be relatively safe from scammers. However, there is always the chance of falling victim to a binary options scam. In the unfortunate event that this happens to you, don&rsquo;t panic &mdash; you may still be able to get your money back.</p>\n<h3>How To Get My Money Back From a Binary Options Trading Scam</h3>\n<p>If you think you&rsquo;ve fallen victim to one of the different types of binary options trading scams out there, the best thing to do is work with a chargeback company to try and retrieve your stolen funds.</p>\n<p>Chargeback companies, such as PayBack Ltd, are fund recovery specialists who know the ins and outs of the many different investment scams, including binary options scams.

This article will explain all the basics in easy-to-understand terms, for complete cryptocurrency beginners.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What Is Cryptocurrency?</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that is typically built using blockchain technology. Unlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies are not issued or regulated by central authorities, such as governments or banks.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>How Did Cryptocurrency Come About?</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Cryptocurrency first came about after the 2007-2008 financial crisis. It was created as an alternative to the world&rsquo;s traditional currency, with the goal of creating a currency that wasn&rsquo;t dependent on banks and governments for value.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What Is Mining Cryptocurrency?</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mining in the name given to the process by which new cryptocurrency is created and enters the market. Crypto miners compete against one another using large amounts of computer processing power to validate crypto transactions and earn crypto coins doing so.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>How Does Cryptocurrency Work?</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Cryptocurrency is bought and sold via various different exchange platforms, much like national currencies, stocks, and other investment assets. You can use crypto for buying and selling things, just like real money. Like other types of assets, the value of cryptocurrency rises and falls, and different cryptocurrencies have different values.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Centralized vs. Decentralized Networks</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Cryptocurrency is a decentralized currency, meaning that it does not rely on a single network or entity to control it. Crypto is built on top of decentralized blockchain technology, which means that the technology behind it is distributed across a wide range of networks and computers. This is what allows cryptocurrencies to exist outside of traditional currency frameworks created by governments and financial institutions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What Are the Main Different Types of Cryptocurrency?</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/5dce10b70e6a4e477146a8ad747d25e4.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/5dce10b70e6a4e477146a8ad747d25e4.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"389\"></picture></p>\n<p></p>\n<h5>Bitcoin and Altcoin (e.g., Ethereum)</h5>\n<p></p>\n<p>Bitcoin was the first major cryptocurrency, and it&rsquo;s still one of the most popular among crypto investors. After Bitcoin&rsquo;s huge success, other types of Altcoins were invented in the same style. Two of the most popular Bitcoin alternatives are Ethereum and Tether.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h5>Tokens</h5>\n<p></p>\n<p>Crypto tokens are another popular type of cryptocurrency that represents a specific asset. For example, blockchain-powered startups are issuing their own tokens that you can buy to own a stake in them, just like how stocks work.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h5>What Is PI Cryptocurrency?</h5>\n<p></p>\n<p>PI cryptocurrency is a relatively new type of cryptocurrency that runs on the Pi network. It is touted as being the first crypto that you can mine from your phone via a mobile app.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h5>Are Cryptocurrencies Legal?</h5>\n<p></p>\n<p>The legality of cryptocurrencies varies across the world. At the time of writing, cryptocurrency is legal in much of the world but has been banned in 9 countries, including China. Since it is decentralized, it is hard to regulate cryptocurrency, and it still inhabits somewhat of a legal gray area in many countries.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Why Are Cryptocurrencies So Popular?</h2>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Doesn&rsquo;t rely on governments and banks for value</li>\n<li>The value of many cryptocurrencies is going up</li>\n<li>May become the money of the future</li>\n<li>An alternative investment to stocks and other assets</li>\n<li>Can be used for a growing number of day-to-day transactions</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What Is Cryptocurrency Used For, If It Isn&rsquo;t Physical Money?</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Even though it&rsquo;s not physical money, cryptocurrency functions like traditional currency. Other than buying and selling it purely for investment purposes, you can use cryptocurrency to buy and sell regular things.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Though crypto is still not an accepted form of currency everywhere, more and more companies are starting to offer goods and services in exchange for cryptocurrency payments. For example, you can buy food using crypto at some restaurants and fast-food chains, including Subway. You can even buy a Tesla with crypto now!</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Newest Cryptocurrencies of 2022: Both Fake and Real</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h5>Lucky Block</h5>\n<p></p>\n<p>Lucky Block is a new cryptocurrency described as a crypto lottery. However, as with many new cryptocurrencies, it&rsquo;s hard to verify information about the company and its technology, so investing in this crypto is truly a gamble.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h5>Shiba Inu</h5>\n<p></p>\n<p>Shiba Inu is a crypto that&rsquo;s been making a lot of headlines lately because it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s known as a &ldquo;meme coin,&rdquo; or a coin created as a bit of a joke. However, it is now considered a legitimate cryptocurrency by many. You can buy and sell it just like major cryptocurrencies, but it may be much more volatile than more established crypto brands, such as Bitcoin.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h5>Squid Crypto</h5>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/squid-crypto-collapses/\">Squid Crypto</a> was a cryptocurrency inspired by the vastly popular Squid Game series, but it turned out to be a complete scam. In this case, the scammers operated what is known as a &ldquo;rug pull&rdquo; scam, meaning they built up a bunch of hype, sold a bunch of Squid Crypto to investors, then disappeared with the money and didn&rsquo;t let investors resell their crypto.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What Is The Safest Platform To Buy Cryptocurrencies?</h2>\n<p>\t</p>\n<p>Coinbase is one of the most popular crypto exchange platforms. Another one that&rsquo;s considered secure is Binance. Though it may be safe to buy and sell crypto on these platforms, it&rsquo;s important to know that it is still possible to fall victim to cryptocurrency scams. This is because the platforms do not have control over the legitimacy of the currencies that are traded on them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>How Do I Protect Myself From Cryptocurrency Scams?</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>To protect yourself and your wallet from crypto scams, it&rsquo;s very important to do your research before committing to buying any cryptocurrency. There are thousands of different types of crypto available these days, and there are lots of scammers taking advantage of naive investors.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When you&rsquo;re considering buying cryptocurrency, make sure to research the company thoroughly. Look up the people involved and read opinions and reviews from other people who have invested in the crypto already to make sure it&rsquo;s not a scam. Also, be very wary of any promises that sound too good to be true, because they probably are.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve fallen victim to a cryptocurrency scam, <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/contact-us/\">contact Payback today</a>.

This article will go over the basics of what binary options trading is and the risks associated with it.</p>\n<h5>What Is a Binary Option?</h5>\n<p>A binary option is a financial option that can either pay out a fixed price amount or nothing at all. When you buy binary options, you&rsquo;re essentially betting that the price of the option will reach a certain point at a certain time, at which you sell it. You can either be right or wrong, which is why binary options are known as all-or-nothing options.</p>\n<h5>Binary Options vs. Options: What&rsquo;s the Difference?</h5>\n<p>Unlike other types of options, binary options don&rsquo;t allow you to purchase or hold the underlying asset. As soon as your binary options contract expires, you receive a fixed amount or nothing. Thus, binary options are even more risky than other types of options.</p>\n<h5>What Are Binary Options Signals?</h5>\n<p>Binary options signals are notifications that you purchase from a company or an investment advisor that tell you when and what binary options to trade. These signals can even come from trading bots and algorithms, and are very risky to purchase because there are lots of scam signals out there.</p>\n<h5>What Are Binary Options on Stocks?</h5>\n<p>Some types of binary options are based on individual stocks or stock indexes, meaning that traders speculate on the underlying stocks to guide their binary options trading decisions.</p>\n<h2>How Do Binary Options Work?</h2>\n<h6>1. The Underlying Market</h6>\n<p>Binary option values are based on underlying markets. In other words, as global markets fluctuate, their prices influence how much binary options are worth. When you buy a binary option and speculate on the price it will reach, you&rsquo;re doing so based on how you think a certain market will affect the option&rsquo;s price.</p>\n<h6>2. The Strike Price</h6>\n<p>The binary options strike price is the price which you think the options will reach, at which you will sell them to make a fixed profit. If you are wrong about the strike price and the price of the options stays below it, you don&rsquo;t make anything.</p>\n<h6>3. The Expiration Date and Time</h6>\n<p>The expiration date and time is when your binary options are settled into a cash value. If they surpassed the predicted strike price, you get paid your fixed amount.</p>\n<h2>The 4 Markets You Deal With in Binary Options</h2>\n<h5>Forex</h5>\n<p>Forex is short for foreign exchange market and it is the market where currencies are bought and sold.</p>\n<h5>Stock Indices</h5>\n<p>Stock market indices, or stock indexes, are subsets of the stock market that are bought and sold as a group.</p>\n<h5>Commodities</h5>\n<p>Commodities are raw materials that you can invest in, such as precious metals, oil, natural gas, and agricultural goods.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/59099bfe9a0e773052796e907bb1fb12.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/59099bfe9a0e773052796e907bb1fb12.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"389\"></picture></p>\n<h5>Binary Events</h5>\n<p>Another type of binary options trading is binary events trading. For these types of trades, speculation is based on upcoming events, such as announcements, which can drastically affect the prices of binary options one way or another.</p>\n<h2>What Is Binary Trading?</h2>\n<p>Binary trading is the act of buying and selling binary options. You can do this via a variety of binary options trading platforms.</p>\n<h5>What&rsquo;s the Minimum Deposit for a Binary Trade?</h5>\n<p>The minimum deposit for binary trades varies depending on the platform you trade on. However, it can be as low as $5 USD.</p>\n<h5>How To Trade Binary Options</h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Study different market trends</li>\n<li>Sign up for a binary options trading platform</li>\n<li>Decide which market you want to trade binary options for</li>\n<li>Choose a strike price and expiration date/time</li>\n<li>Make the trade</li>\n<li>Wait for the binary options trade to expire and settle into cash</li>\n</ol>\n<h5>Binary Options Trading Example</h5>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of how a binary options trade might look: let&rsquo;s say that a commodity, oil, is trading at $80 and you want to purchase a binary option for the market. You buy a binary option with a strike price of $85 and an expiration date and time of tomorrow at 1 p.m.</p>\n<p>If the binary option goes above $85 by tomorrow at 1 p.m., you earn a fixed percentage or sum, depending on the terms set forth by the binary options trading platform you used to make the trade. If it stays below $85, you don&rsquo;t make any money.</p>\n<h2>How Are Binary Options Regulated in the US?</h2>\n<p>Binary options are fully legal and regulated in the US, provided that you trade them on an approved US exchange. If you trade on an unregulated exchange, you are more likely to get scammed because they are not subject to the rules of regulated exchanges.</p>\n<h5>Is This the Same Outside of the US?</h5>\n<p>Different countries have different governing bodies that regulate binary options trading. However, the level of regulation varies greatly, and some countries do not regulate binary options trading at all.</p>\n<h2>Can You Get Scammed on a Binary Options Trade?</h2>\n<p>Though binary options in and of themselves are a legitimate trading option, there are many binary options scams out there, including fraudulent binary options brokers. That&rsquo;s why you should always trade binary options via a registered and regulated exchange in your country of residence.</p>\n<p>Unregistered platforms often operate outside the law, and can scam you in a variety of ways. For example, they may refuse to give you payouts or even manipulate data to make it look like you lost on a trade.</p>\n<p>In other cases, binary options scammers have been known to steal credit card information and other financial information and commit identity theft. They can then use your sensitive data to steal large sums of money directly from your accounts.</p>\n<p>There are also many binary options signal scams, in which the scammers provide bad investment advice in exchange for a flat fee. Be especially wary of trading bots offering signals.</p>\n<p>If you think you&rsquo;ve been scammed on binary options trading, contact Payback today.

If you click on the link, it might install malware on your device or it might take you to a site that asks you for sensitive information.</p>\n<h5>How Do Cash App Email Scams Work?</h5>\n<h6>Phishing Email Scam</h6>\n<ul>\n<li>Scammers send an email that looks like it&rsquo;s from Cash App, but the sender&rsquo;s address is off</li>\n<li>They try to get you to send them sensitive data under false pretexts</li>\n<li>If you fall for it, they use your info to steal from you (either from your Cash App account or bank accounts/cards)</li>\n</ul>\n<h6>Spoofing Email Scam</h6>\n<ul>\n<li>A type of Cash App phishing email that contains links to</li>\n<li>The websites look like they are associated with Cash App, but are malicious</li>\n<li>The websites look like they are associated with Cash App, but are malicious</li>\n</ul>\n<h6>Increasing-Your-Money-Quickly Scam</h6>\n<ul>\n<li>Scammers claim they can &ldquo;flip&rdquo; your money and return a larger sum to you</li>\n<li>They ask you for a small Cash App transfer to prove it</li>\n<li>Once you send money, the scammers disappear with it</li>\n</ul>\n<h6>Cash App Giveaway Scam</h6>\n<ul>\n<li>Emails claim that you have won a cash prize on Cash App</li>\n<li>They ask you to make a small transfer in order to receive the prize</li>\n<li>You don&rsquo;t hear anything else about the &ldquo;giveaway&rdquo; and your money is gone</li>\n</ul>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/1e35c81089ad6d3a746ed03dc5ed33ac.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/1e35c81089ad6d3a746ed03dc5ed33ac.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"388\"></picture></p>\n<h2>How to Spot a Cash App Email Scam: Important Things To Look Out For</h2>\n<h6>The Email Address</h6>\n<p>Scammers cannot send emails from an official Cash App email, so always check this first if you get an email claiming to be from Cash App. The sender&rsquo;s address may be a strange combination of numbers and letters, or it might be some form of &ldquo;Cash App&rdquo; misspelled or with additional numbers and letters.</p>\n<h6>Generic Greetings</h6>\n<p>Real company emails typically greet you by your name or username. Fake Cash App emails will often use a strange generic greeting, such as &ldquo;Dear Customer.&rdquo;</p>\n<h6>A Sense of Urgency</h6>\n<p>Cash App phishing emails try to trick you into acting without thinking by creating a sense of urgency. They might claim there is an emergency with your account and say that it has been locked and that you must act immediately to unlock it, for example.</p>\n<h6>Links or Attachments That MUST Be Clicked On</h6>\n<p>Emails pressuring you into clicking on links or attachments are sketchy, period. Legitimate company emails will not ask you to visit links or download attachments for any kind of official business.</p>\n<h6>Spelling and Grammar Mistakes</h6>\n<p>Scammers are often located in countries where English is not the first language, so spelling and grammar mistakes are usually present in fake Cash App emails.</p>\n<h2>How To Protect Yourself From a Cash App Email Scam</h2>\n<h6>Don&rsquo;t Click On Links Asking For Sensitive Information</h6>\n<p>Never click any links or attachments in emails claiming that you need to visit them to provide login information or other sensitive data.</p>\n<h6>Watch Out for Spelling, Grammar, or General Mistakes in the Email</h6>\n<p>Read any email claiming to be from Cash App thoroughly and keep an eye out for errors, which are huge red flags.</p>\n<h6>Highlight the Preview Link By Hovering Over the Link</h6>\n<p>If there are any links in an email claiming to be from Cash App, they are most likely fraudulent. You can preview them by hovering your mouse&rsquo;s pointer over them to see where the link really takes you.</p>\n<h6>If You Spot a Fake Cash App Email, Block and Report It as Spam To Avoid Recurrence</h6>\n<p>Whenever you receive a fake Cash App email, block the sender&rsquo;s address and mark it as spam. This will prevent the scammers from sending you any more emails from that address and help your email client filter out future Cash App phishing emails from your inbox to your spam folder.</p>\n<h2>What To Do if You&rsquo;ve Been Scammed by a Cash App Email Scam</h2>\n<p>If you follow the tips in this article, you should be able to avoid most Cash App email scams.

            "content": "<p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard of email phishing scams before, but did you know that there are phishing scams specifically targeting Gmail users? If you use Gmail, pay special attention to this article to keep yourself safe.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h4>Are You a Gmail.com User? Google Email Scams Can Appear at Any Second</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>Millions of people rely on Google&rsquo;s email service, Gmail, for their day-to-day personal and professional emailing. Scammers know this, which is why they are targeting Gmail users with more and more new Gmail Scams every day.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>What Is a Gmail Phishing Scam?</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>In general, an email phishing scam is any type of scam in which the fraudsters attempt to trick you into handing over sensitive information (e.g., login credentials, credit card numbers, or bank account details) by sending fake emails, which usually appear to be from large, reputable companies.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Gmail phishing scams are a subset of email scams that specifically target Gmail users.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Common Gmail Phishing Scams</h3>\n<p></p>\n<h5>The Fake Sign-In Phishing Scam</h5>\n<p></p>\n<p>One of the most common new Gmail scams is known as the fake sign-in phishing scam, which is designed to get you to unsuspectingly provide your Gmail login credentials to scammers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h6>How Does the Fake Sign-In Phishing Scam Work?</h6>\n<p></p>\n<p>This scam starts with you receiving an email from a trusted source (usually a contact who has already fallen for the scam) with a link for you to click on. The link takes you to a spoofed, or fake, version of the Gmail login screen and asks you for your username and password.</p>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n<h6>What Happens To Victims of This Gmail Scam?</h6>\n<p>\t\t</p>\n<p>If you fall for this scam and provide your login credentials, the scammers steal all the personal information they can from your Gmail account. They also take advantage of your contacts, sending them phishing emails from your account to keep the scam rolling, accumulating more and more victims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h6>How To Protect Yourself from This Scam</h6>\n<p></p>\n<p>To avoid this Gmail scam, don&rsquo;t click on unknown links in emails, even if they appear to be from trusted sources. You can hover over any links with your mouse to preview them and see where they really take you.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you do happen to click on a link that takes you to what looks like a Gmail login screen, never enter your login info. Only access your Gmail directly by going to Gmail.com and logging in.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h5>Bait Attack</h5>\n<p></p>\n<p>Another prolific Gmail scam is called the bait attack scam. Here&rsquo;s how it works and how to keep yourself safe&hellip;</p>\n<p></p>\n<h6>How Does a &lsquo;Bait Attack&rsquo; Work?</h6>\n<p></p>\n<p> A bait attack scam typically starts with you receiving a blank email with a simple, vague subject line. The scammers hope that curiosity gets the best of you and that you open the email. They can then gauge how likely you are to open a second email from them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If they think you are a good target for the second phase of a bait attack, the scammers will send another email that appears to be from an antivirus software company, such as Norton. They&rsquo;ll try to create a sense of urgency by telling you your device is infected with a virus, or something along those lines, and ask you for sensitive information in order to fix the problem or ask you to click on a link to download and install antivirus software. The link is malicious and really installs malware on your device.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h6>Gmail&rsquo;s Warning Against This New Gmail Scam</h6>\n<p></p>\n<p>Although not completely unique to Gmail, Google has warned that this type of scam overwhelmingly targets Gmail users (about 90% of bait attacks target Gmail accounts).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h6>How To Protect Yourself from This Scam</h6>\n<p></p>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t open emails from unknown senders with vague subject lines and don&rsquo;t click on unknown links or attachments in emails. Instead, mark them as spam to avoid receiving more from the same senders.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Also, know that legitimate companies will never ask you for sensitive data via email.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Craigslist Gmail Scam</h3>\n<p></p>\n<h6>How Does the Craigslist Gmail Scam Work?</h6>\n<p></p>\n<p>In this scam, the fraudsters pose as buyers or sellers on Craigslist and start corresponding back and forth with you about an item. They try to take any information from the body of your emails, such as your email address, name, and phone number contained in a signature, which they then use to try and hack your Gmail account by entering it on the account recovery page.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When they do this, Gmail sends an account recovery code to your phone. The scammers then try to trick you into believing that this is a code they sent you to prove you are a real person before making a deal with you on Craigslist, and they ask you for the code.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h6>What Happens To Victims of the Craigslist Scam?</h6>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you hand over a Gmail verification code to scammers, they can reset your account password and take full control of your Gmail account. They can then run wild in your email, potentially contacting your friends and family and asking for money, or committing other types of identity theft and fraud.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h6>How To Protect Yourself from This Scam</h6>\n<p></p>\n<p>Keep personal information out of your emails whenever you are dealing with people via Craigslist, so they can&rsquo;t try to reset your password. If you receive a Gmail verification code without requesting it, be very wary of anyone you are talking to on Craigslist at the time, and never tell anyone else what the code is.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h6>How To Report a Scam to Gmail</h6>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to your Gmail account</li>\n<li>Open an email you want to report</li>\n<li>Click on &ldquo;More&rdquo; next to &ldquo;Reply&rdquo; for the email</li>\n<li>You suspect to be from scammers</li>\n<li>Click &ldquo;Report Phishing&rdquo;</li>\n</ol>\n<p></p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/d5523beadba60d97b0068b1a2cb2e208.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/d5523beadba60d97b0068b1a2cb2e208.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"389\"></picture></p>\n<p></p>\n<h6>How Payback Can Help You Recover From a Gmail Scam</h6>\n<p></p>\n<p>Payback&rsquo;s team of fund recovery specialists have extensive experience in getting money back from all types of online scams and scammers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We will do everything we can to track down the perpetrators of Gmail scams and retrieve your money from them by pressing them where it hurts: their finances.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/contact-us/\">Contact Payback today</a> if you have fallen victim to a Gmail phishing email or any other type of scam.</p>\n",

            "content": "<p>Cash App is a prolific P2P payment platform that millions of users are currently sending money back and forth on. However, it is also home to something called Cash App flip scams, which target users to steal money from them by claiming they can &ldquo;flip&rdquo; their money, or turn it into more in a very short amount of time.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/35ead71aa194445e94384d93e9af7272.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/35ead71aa194445e94384d93e9af7272.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"389\"></picture></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Is Cash App a Scam?</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Cash App itself is not a scam, but scammers have figured out ways to take advantage of the platform for their own gains. Keep reading to find out how you can avoid becoming the victim of a cash app money flip scam.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>How Do Cash App Flip Scams Work?</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h3>1. A Post on Social Media To Lure in Victims</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Cash App scammers typically start by making posts and comments on social media, especially Instagram, claiming that they made thousands of dollars by flipping money on Cash App. They claim it&rsquo;s so easy that anyone can do it and that they&rsquo;ll tell you how!</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>2. Target Participants of Cash App Giveaways</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Scammers often post their comments on Cash App&rsquo;s real instagram account when there are Cash App giveaways (which are real promotions the company uses to market itself). This gets them seen by a lot of people who are already looking for easy money and using the app.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>3. Personal Messages To Convince the User</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Once you message a Cash App scammer to find out how you can &ldquo;earn thousands of dollars&rdquo; by flipping money on the app, they&rsquo;ll start corresponding with you to make their offer appear even more legitimate.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>4. Ask You To Send $10-$1000 Through the App for Investing</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>As soon as the scammers think they have you hooked, they&rsquo;ll ask you to send them a sum of money on Cash App, usually from $10-$1000, to prove how their &ldquo;flipping&rdquo; strategy works.</p>\n<h2>Once the Money Is Received, the Scammer May Ask You To Send More Money</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>If they&rsquo;re feeling lucky after the first payment, the scammers might give you more money back than you sent them originally to prove that &ldquo;flipping&rdquo; works and get you to trust them. Then, they&rsquo;ll ask you for a second, larger payment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Scammer Stops Responding to the Messages</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Once the scammer has all the money they think they can get out of you, they stop responding to your messages, or &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; you. This means they are never planning on giving any of your money back!</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>How To Avoid Money Flipping Scams</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h3>1. Treat Your Cash App Account Like a Bank Account</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>You would never willingly hand over your bank account details or transfer money from your bank account to a stranger who claims they can magically flip it for you, right? So, be just as cautious when using Cash App as you would using your bank account.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>2. Be Aware of Red Flags</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>The biggest red flag to watch out for on Cash App, and anywhere online, is a promise of a quick return on your investment in exchange for you doing nothing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Also, be wary of any stranger claiming that they can make you money in exchange for an up-front payment, however small that payment may be.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There are lots of legitimate types of investments out there you can make, but almost all of them require you to invest substantial amounts of money and wait for some period of time before you actually see any significant return on your investment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>3. If It Sounds Too Good To Be True, It Is</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Has anyone ever come up to you on the street, asked you for $5, and handed you back $10 in return? Probably not, right?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This too-good-to-be-true scenario is just as unlikely to happen online, so don&rsquo;t believe anyone who&rsquo;s promising you huge returns out of the blue, and treat anyone you meet online with as much caution as you would someone you meet in real life.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>4. Check Usernames and Phone Numbers Before Sending Money</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Whenever you&rsquo;re sending money via Cash App, even to someone you think you know, always double-check their usernames and phone numbers before you hit send.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One way to do this is by entering usernames and phone numbers into an open source intelligence tool online. These are databases of publicly available information that can show you if a username or number is associated with fraud.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>5. Remember That Cash App Has No Support Line</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Sometimes scammers pose as representatives of Cash App and post a support phone number to convince users that they are legitimate. Cash App does not have a support line, so this is another huge red flag to look out for.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you ever do need to contact Cash App for support, you can do so via <a href=\"http://cash.app/help\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cash.app/help</a>.

Because of its good reputation, scammers utilize eBay to try and trick unsuspecting users into making fa</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Is eBay a Scam?</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>The eBay auction site is not a scam. It&rsquo;s a very reliable and secure way to buy and sell things. In fact, there are many individuals and businesses who make a living strictly through eBay!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for rare or vintage items, or just want to score a great deal on something you need, eBay is a great place to look.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Does eBay Have Scam Protection?</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Fortunately, eBay scam protection does exist! The company offers something called the eBay Money Back Guarantee, which covers almost all transactions on the site.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you get scammed and an item you buy doesn&rsquo;t arrive, is different from the item listed, or is faulty or damaged, you can get your money back from eBay directly.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Most Jaw-dropping eBay Scams</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h3>1. Unusual Payment Method Scam</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>The most common forms of payment on eBay are PayPal and credit card payments. These also happen to be the safest ways to pay because they are protected forms of payment.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>One common type of eBay scam involves sellers requesting payment for items via alternative payment methods, such as an unregulated/unmonitored cash transfer app or something similar.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h4>How To Avoid: Stick To Your Guns</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>Luckily, this type of eBay scam is very easy to avoid. All you have to do is stick to the regulated payment methods when you make a purchase on eBay and you&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/7313d14999d501ecafe2df614b4d55cf.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/7313d14999d501ecafe2df614b4d55cf.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"390\"></picture></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>2. Malware Via Email Scam</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>This eBay scam doesn&rsquo;t take place via the site. Instead, <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/6-common-phishing-scams-you-need-to-know-in-2021/\">scammers create fake emails that appear to be from eBay</a> in an effort to get you to click on malicious links that install malware on your device and steal information from you.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h4>How To Avoid: Always Double-, Triple-, and Quadruple-Check Emails</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you ever receive an email that looks like it&rsquo;s from eBay, scrutinize it to make sure it&rsquo;s authentic before you click on any links in it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Look at the email address it&rsquo;s sent from to make sure it&rsquo;s authentic and Google the address if you&rsquo;re not sure. Scammers might use an email address that&rsquo;s close to eBay&rsquo;s, but with one letter or number off.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Other red flags in eBay scam emails are spelling/grammar mistakes and odd language or phrasing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>3. The Hidden Link Scam</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>In some cases, eBay scammers hide links in their listings that take you to another third-party site where they sell fake goods. If you buy something on one of these sites, you aren&rsquo;t protected by eBay once you realize it&rsquo;s not the real deal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h4>How To Avoid: Avoid Clicking Blindly</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>To avoid this type of eBay scam, don&rsquo;t click blindly on links in eBay listings. If you do happen to click on a link that takes you off the site, don&rsquo;t buy anything from the alternative marketplace.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>4. The Misleading Photo Scam</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>In some cases, eBay scammers trick you into buying something that&rsquo;s different from what you think it is by uploading a misleading photo.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For example, they might upload a photo of a camera and a case for a very low price, so you think you&rsquo;re buying both items. However, they also bury in the product description a disclosure that you&rsquo;re only buying the camera case.\n</p>\n<p>In an even more brazen version of this eBay scam, the scammers ship you an actual photo of the item you think you&rsquo;re buying.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h4>How To Avoid: Check Everything Matches Before Paying</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>To avoid the misleading photo eBay scam, always read product descriptions thoroughly and make sure they match the photo and listing title.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>5. eBay Motors Scam</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Beware of any car-for-sale listings you see on other marketplaces, such as Facebook Marketplace, that claim they are selling the car via eBay Motors. There are fake listings out there using eBay&rsquo;s good name to get you to pay for a car that doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h4>How To Avoid: Don&rsquo;t Pay Money Before You View The Car</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>To avoid an eBay Motors scam, never pay money for a car before you&rsquo;ve had a chance to see it and test drive it in person.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>6. Incorrect Shipping Name Scam</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Another way fraudulent sellers try to scam people via eBay is by shipping items you buy with an incorrect name. They do this in the hope that you&rsquo;ll see the wrong name and simply return the package to them without looking inside, so they can sell the same item multiple times.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h4>How To Avoid: Open Packages If You Are Expecting </h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you are expecting a package from an eBay purchase and you receive one with an incorrect name, check inside to see if the item you ordered is in there, rather than just returning it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>7. Empty Box Scam</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>The empty box eBay scam works similarly to the misleading photo scam. In this case, sellers upload a photo of a product &ldquo;in its box.&rdquo; Then, if you buy the item thinking you&rsquo;re getting a great deal, they send you just the empty box.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h4>How To Avoid: Check Everything Thoroughly</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>Scammers hide information in product descriptions to cover their bases. So, whenever you buy something that is pictured in a box, read the description carefully to make sure you are getting what&rsquo;s supposed to be IN the box.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There is also an eBay buyer scam in which a scammer will buy something from you, then claim they received an empty box to get their money back from eBay and send you back the empty box. To avoid this, document every step of your sales with photographs and videos, so you can contest any issues with eBay.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>8. eBay Gift Card Scam</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>In an eBay gift card scam, scammers typically reach out to you via phone or social media and ask for some type of urgent payment using an eBay gift card.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h4>How To Avoid: Never Give Or Send Your Gift Card Code Anywhere</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>eBay gift cards are only valid for paying directly within the eBay platform. So, never give an eBay gift card code out to anyone who contacts you out of the blue asking for an eBay gift card payment outside of the site.

Copying Coupons</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Scammers commonly create counterfeit coupons by simply copying existing coupons and trying to use them at different locations of the same store.</p>\n<h3>2. Printing Too Many Coupons</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Another common way to make fake coupons is to print multiple coupons in order to try and dupe retailers into giving them the same discount more than once.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/339672141216f2310d253bd28d401c34.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/339672141216f2310d253bd28d401c34.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"389\"></picture></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>3. Decoding Coupons</h3>\n<p>All the numbers on a coupon&rsquo;s barcode indicate something about what it can be used for, so scammers try to decode the numbers and create fake coupons for different products.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>4. Buying or Selling Coupons</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Coupons are free and intended to be used by the customer they are given to, or their friends or family, but scammers commit coupon fraud by selling coupons to make a profit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>5. Stealing Coupon Circulars</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Retailers often send out coupons in newspapers and magazines, and fraudsters go around stealing these to get their hands on all the coupons.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>6. Retailer Coupon Fraud: Redeeming Coupons for Unsold Products</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>In some cases, retailers alter their records to make it look like they sold products using a coupon in order to claim rebates or refunds from suppliers/manufacturers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h4>Retailer Coupon Fraud: Raise Prices To Counteract Losses</h4>\n<p></p>\n<p>Another type of retailer coupon con involves the retailers raising prices of discounted items, so you think you&rsquo;re getting a good deal on an item when really you&rsquo;re paying the original price.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Biggest Coupon Scam in US History</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Using fake coupons is no joke. In 2020, a Virginia Beach woman was sentenced to 12 years in prison for running a coupon counterfeiting ring that lost retailers an estimated $31.8 million in fake discounts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The woman, along with her husband, were running coupon cons for approximately 3 years before getting caught. They made fake coupons that were almost identical to real ones, but with much higher discounts, and sold them to bargain hunters via Facebook and Telegram.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the end, their illicit activities caught up to them, but there are many other coupon scammers out there running similar operations that you need to be on the lookout for.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/0eb915fc74197cbd552153e3e4b3ed54.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/0eb915fc74197cbd552153e3e4b3ed54.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"389\"></picture></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>How To Tell if a Coupon Is Fake</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h3>1. It&rsquo;s Too Good To Be True</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>The best way to avoid any type of scam is to be very wary of deals that sound too good to be true. Retailers rarely, if ever, offer crazy deals, like 75% off an item worth hundreds of dollars.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Coupons for small deals on day-to-day products, like groceries and household goods, are much more likely to be authentic.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>2. It Looks Photocopied, Scanned, Or Fake-Printed</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you receive a coupon on printer paper and it looks poor quality, there&rsquo;s a good chance it&rsquo;s a fake coupon. Also, if a coupon looks like it&rsquo;s from a magazine or newspaper, it should be printed on both sides.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>3. The UPC Is Suspicious</h3>\n<p>The coupon UPC, or barcode, contains all the information about the deal, so retailers can scan it to apply the discount. Inspect any coupon&rsquo;s UPC for signs of tampering, such as smudging or evidence of photoshopping.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>4. You Are Asked To Pay Up-Front Fees</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Coupons are always offered by retailers for free, so you should never have to pay anything to receive a coupon. If someone tries to sell you a coupon, walk away &mdash; it&rsquo;s almost always a scam.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>5. The Expiry Date Is Longer Than Normal</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Most coupons are only valid for short periods, from a few days to a few weeks, and are rarely valid for more than a month. So, be cautious about any coupons that have long periods of validity.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>How To Protect Yourself From Coupon Fraud Allegations</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h3>1. Read The Ts&amp;Cs</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>The &ldquo;Ts&amp;Cs,&rdquo; or terms and conditions, are the fine print on a coupon. They specify what the coupon can and can&rsquo;t be used for and how it has to be applied. The terms and conditions should always match up with the large print on a coupon, so ensure that this is the case before you try to use any coupon.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>2. Ask If You Are Unsure</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you are suspicious of a coupon you received, there&rsquo;s no harm in asking the retailer whether or not it&rsquo;s legit. That way, there&rsquo;s no doubt that you are a real customer simply looking for a discount, but you want to make sure the coupon is authentic.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Retailers: Don&rsquo;t Hand Out Coupons if You Can&rsquo;t Deal With the Losses!</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Though there is more technology than ever for detecting fake coupons, scammers are always finding new creative ways to get around it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>So, if you&rsquo;re a retailer, make sure you are prepared for the possibility of losing some money to coupon fraud before you start handing out coupons.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Weigh the pros and cons of offering coupon discounts and make sure the positives outweigh the negatives!

            "content": "<p>Skype is a great communication platform for calling anyone in the world without having to pay a cent. But, there are Skype scams out there that you should be aware of and watch out for. Keep reading to find out what some of the most unbelievable Skype scams are.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>6 of the Most Unbelievable Skype Scams</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h3>1. Skype Sextortion Scams</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>There was a recent case of a Skype blackmail scam that involved a Middle Eastern man getting tricked into performing sexual acts on camera for who he thought was a beautiful woman that was romantically interested in him.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In this case, the &ldquo;woman&rdquo; reached out to him via Facebook, then asked to chat via Skype. One thing led to another, and the man was tricked into letting his guard (and his pants) down.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After the call ended, he received a message that said the person he was talking to was really a man and that he had recorded the whole video. The scammer threatened to send the video to a list of friends and family from Facebook if the victim didn&rsquo;t pay up.</p>\n<p>This is just one real-world example of a type of Skype sex scam to be wary of.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>2. Tinder Skype Scams</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the example above, scammers used Facebook to reel their victim in. However, they have also been known to take advantage of people looking for love on Tinder and <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/scams-on-dating-sites-are-real-2021-guide/\">other relationship sites</a> and ask them to connect via Skype, before proceeding to blackmail them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>3. Skype Malware Scams</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Another kind of Skype blackmail scam involves scammers posing as potential employers or even government officials and requesting to connect via Skype. Then, they send files to download via Skype that install malware on your device to steal sensitive data and even take control of your webcam.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>4. The Skype Ghana Scam</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Another prominent Skype scam to be aware of is known as the Ghana Skype scam. In this scam, women from Ghana reach out to men in other countries via Skype, claiming they are interested in them and just want to talk.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>They then go on to earn their victim&rsquo;s trust, and eventually come up with some kind of story to get the unsuspecting men to send them money. Of course, the person they are talking to is just a scammer, and probably not even a woman.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>5. Skype Interview Scams</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Another way scammers use Skype is by hosting fake job interviews. They list fake jobs on sites like LinkedIn and other job boards, then hold interviews with their victims via Skype.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The scammers go to a lot of effort to make their targets feel like it&rsquo;s a real job interview, then offer them a job and ask for personal information, such as Social Security numbers and bank account info, to proceed with the process.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>6. Skype Automated Message Scam</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>In this final entry on our list of common Skype scams, the scammers send automated messages over Skype telling you that your laptop or other device is working slowly and needs to be repaired. They then direct you to perform certain processes that end up giving them control over your device, so they can steal data from you or blackmail you.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>How To Spot and Avoid a Skype Scam</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Carry Out Social Media and Google Image Searches</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you talk to anyone on Skype that you haven&rsquo;t met in person, always investigate their profiles on social media to make sure they are authentic. Also, you can save their profile picture and upload it into the Google image search bar and do a search to determine whether it appears anywhere else online, which tells you if you&rsquo;re being catfished.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Never Give Out Your Bank or Card Details To a Stranger on Skype</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>This one is pretty self explanatory. Never, ever send financial details, such as bank account numbers or credit card info, to anyone over Skype.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/fb8f78c0881631b94ef0fc10915daec7.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/fb8f78c0881631b94ef0fc10915daec7.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"389\"></picture></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Block Friend Requests from Strangers on Skype</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Skype is not a dating site or a social networking site. Any strangers that reach out to you via Skype are probably just trying to scam you, so block their friend requests and don&rsquo;t engage with them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t Be Fooled by Friend Requests on Facebook</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>As we mentioned earlier, scammers often use Facebook or other social networking sites to trick their victims into talking over Skype. So, if a stranger adds you on Facebook and asks to talk on Skype, be VERY suspicious of them. This is especially true if they claim to be looking for a romantic connection.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Carry Out Video Calls Over Skype</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Scammers usually don&rsquo;t want to show themselves via video and typically prefer to stick to text-based chat. They can play pre-recorded videos to trick you into thinking you are talking to a beautiful woman or someone else, but they leave the audio off with some excuse for doing so.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the example at the beginning of the article, of the man getting tricked into performing sexual acts on video, he was fooled because he never actually spoke to the woman he was seeing on the video. It was pre-recorded and the scammers were just sending text messages via SKype as the video played.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What To Do If You Are Scammed On Skype?</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Report the Scam To the FTC</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>The FTC is the government body responsible for handling scams in the United States. If you live in the US, the first thing to do after getting scammed on Skype is report the scam to them. If you live elsewhere, do a Google search to find out where to report Skype scams in your country.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Block the User</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>After you realize you get scammed, immediately stop all communication with the scammers and block their account. This will protect you from any further damage.

            "content": "<p>Telegram, the free cross-platform, cloud-based instant messaging app, has been gaining a lot of users recently because of how secure it is. Events like the 2021 Facebook outage, which also shut down the vastly popular WhatsApp instant messaging service, have pushed users towards Telegram in search of a more stable, secure messaging platform.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, as with all online platforms, it&rsquo;s possible to fall victim to a scam via Telegram. In this article, we&rsquo;ll tell you what to look out for and how to avoid Telegram app scams.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/811bf238845d879de48a7697b63c73f7.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/811bf238845d879de48a7697b63c73f7.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"389\"></picture></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Is Telegram App a Scam</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Telegram app is not a scam service in any way. In fact, it is widely regarded as the most secure third-party messaging app on the market right now.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Why Are Telegram Scams So Common?</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Wherever there are large user bases, there are going to be scammers. Fraudsters are always looking for new platforms that allow them to target their unsuspecting victims. So, naturally, Telegram has attracted their attention recently.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Most Common Telegram App Scams of 2021</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h3>1. SMSRanger Bot</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>SMSRanger is a bot used by both seasoned hackers and novice cybercriminals to target unsuspecting Telegram users.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In this scam, one of the most common Telegram scams out there, the scammers program the bot to send out automated messages that appear to be from a bank or another financial institution, like PayPal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you engage with the bot, the script leads you to believe that you need to give it your password or other account information for some reason. Of course, the scammers just use this information to steal from you.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>2. SMS Buster</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>SMS Buster is a similar bot to the SMSRanger bot, but it&rsquo;s script is able to collect even more sensitive information, such as credit card CVV codes and credit card numbers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>3. Telegram Job Scams</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Another of the most prevalent Telegram messenger scams is known as a Telegram job scam, a Telegram employment scam, or a Telegram interview scam.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In this type of scam, the fraudsters target people looking for work with fake job advertisements, typically posted on LinkedIn or other job sites. The scammers know that people looking for employment are often desperate, and thus can make easy targets.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Once you apply for one of these fake jobs, the scammers conduct fake interviews via Telegram. They do this because they cannot be traced through the app.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Telegram interview scams can work in different ways, but the scammers always string you along to make it seem like a real job application process.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Finally, they offer you a job and, if you accept, they go on to ask you for sensitive personal data, such as your Social Security number or bank account details. They then disappear and use this data to steal from you or commit identity theft.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>4. Telegram Crypto Fraud Scams</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Crypto scammers often leverage Telegram to run <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/the-155-million-pump-and-dump-stock-scam-in-hong-kong/\">&ldquo;pump and dump&rdquo;</a> scams. This means they gather a group of eager, usually new/naive investors, in a Telegram group under the pretense of offering investment advice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Then, the scammers buy up large amounts of certain cryptocurrencies before giving &ldquo;advice&rdquo; to everyone in the group to go buy the same ones. Once they do so, the price goes up, and the scammers sell off all the cryptocurrencies for a profit, leaving group members in the dust.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>5. Telegram Giveaway Scams</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Another kind of telegram scam to watch out for is the fake Telegram giveaway scam. In this scam, scammers (or scam bots) reach out to users and pretend to be offering a giveaway from some well-known company, especially cash transfer apps and crypto wallets.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Of course, to receive your &ldquo;giveaway&rdquo; reward, you have to give the scammers money or sensitive information first. Then, they disappear and your prize never materializes.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>How To Avoid Telegram Scams and Secure Your Account</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h3>1. Never Share Your Passwords, 2-Factor Security Codes, or Email Access With Anyone<br />\n<br />\n</h3>\n<p>If there was a &ldquo;staying safe online 101&rdquo; course, this would be the first lesson. No matter what, never give anyone your passwords, security codes, login information, or any other sensitive data over Telegram.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>2. Use 2-Factor Authentication</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>To make your Telegram account even more secure, turn on 2-factor authentication in the settings menu. This makes it very hard for anyone to hack your account.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>3. The Stronger the Password, the Better</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>It may be tempting to use your birthday or your pet&rsquo;s name as a Telegram password, but it&rsquo;s not a good idea. Hackers can easily look on social media to find this info and guess your password.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Instead, choose a random combination of letters or words, and include numbers, special symbols, and a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters. The more complex your password is, the less likely it is that anyone can get into your account.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>4. Carry Out Job Interviews on Zoom or in Person</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for work, be very cautious about the interview process to avoid Telegram job scams.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If someone ever requests to interview you via Telegram, push back and ask them to interview you via a video call on Zoom, or request an in-person interview if the company claims to be local. That way, you can see who you&rsquo;re talking to and avoid getting scammed on Telegram.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/912877b8bc06028561f3449719800c54.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/912877b8bc06028561f3449719800c54.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"389\"></picture></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>5. If in Doubt, Block</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>The reality is nobody you don&rsquo;t know should ever be reaching out to you on Telegram. So, if an unknown individual starts messaging you, even if they seem to be legit, chances are it&#8217;s a scammer or a scam bot.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Whenever you have even a sneaky suspicion that someone is not who they say they are on Telegram, just block them. You have nothing to lose by playing it safe on Telegram.

            "content": "<p>There are more than 2.5 billion active WhatsApp users worldwide &mdash; that&rsquo;s a lot of potential WhatsApp scam victims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Though WhatsApp is an incredibly useful, not to mention free, app for texting and calling people anywhere in the world, it&rsquo;s important to know what to look out for to protect yourself from scammers.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>5 of the Most Common WhatsApp Scams</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h3>1. &ldquo;Friend In Need&rdquo;/Six-Digit Code Scam</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>In a WhatsApp code scam, you receive an unsolicited six-digit code from scammers, which looks like the code you receive if you&rsquo;re verifying your account or logging in on a different device.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After you get the code, you&rsquo;ll receive a message from who you think is a friend or family member asking for the code so they can unlock their account. If you send the code over, the scammers can use it to hijack your WhatsApp account.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h5>How To Protect Yourself From This Scam:</h5>\n<p></p>\n<p>Never send a code you receive through WhatsApp to anyone, even if you think it&rsquo;s someone you know.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>2. Tinder WhatsApp Scam</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Tinder WhatsApp scams are another common type of scam to look out for. In this type of WhatsApp scam, someone you match with through tinder will invite you to talk with them via WhatsApp.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, they are really <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/5-common-tinder-scams-to-be-aware-of-in-2021/\">scammers who create fake Tinder profiles</a> to lure unsuspecting people looking for love into giving them sensitive data or sending them money after they&rsquo;ve been talking for a while.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Once a Tinder WhatsApp scammer thinks they have you hooked, they might make up a story about being in financial trouble and ask you to help them out, or they might try to tease sensitive private information out of you that they can use to perpetrate identity theft.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h5>How To Spot A Tinder WhatsApp Scam:</h5>\n<p></p>\n<p>Be wary of any potential romantic connection you talk to on WhatsApp who you haven&rsquo;t met in real life, especially if they start asking for personal information or money.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Never send money or private information to someone you matched with on Tinder and are talking to via WhatsApp.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>3. WhatsApp Gold Scam</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>WhatsApp Gold is a fake version of the app that claims to be for celebrities and other VIP users. Scammers send you emails or messages stating that a new version of WhatsApp is available and telling you to upgrade now.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>However, if you click the link to download WhatsApp Gold, it will install malware on your device that takes it hostage or steals sensitive data from you.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h5>How To Spot a WhatsApp Gold Scam:</h5>\n<p></p>\n<p>There is no such thing as WhatsApp Gold, or any &ldquo;premium&rdquo; version of WhatsApp. Don&rsquo;t believe any messages claiming there is or asking you to upgrade your version of the app.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>4. Supermarket WhatsApp Scams</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>There are WhatsApp scam messages that appear to be vouchers from big supermarket chains that contain links you have to click on to supposedly claim the offer. But, these links are false and will install malware on your device or take you to malicious sites designed to steal your info.</p>\n<h5>How To Avoid This Scam:</h5>\n<p></p>\n<p>Most big brands don&rsquo;t send out offers via WhatsApp, so be wary of any unsolicited messages you receive claiming to be from supermarkets or other well-known companies. Also, always look for spelling and grammar mistakes in messages you receive &mdash; these are huge red flags. Finally, never click on any unknown links in WhatsApp messages.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>5. Fake Delivery WhatsApp Scams</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>In this final common type of WhatsApp scam, the fraudsters send you a message claiming that they have a delivery for you. They&rsquo;ll ask you to go to a sketchy site and fill out personal information and make a payment to receive the delivery.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h5>How To Spot a Fake Delivery Scam:</h5>\n<p></p>\n<p>Legitimate delivery companies should not request payments or info via WhatsApp. If anything, they will come to your door with a credit card machine if you have to pay something extra. Also, if you aren&rsquo;t expecting a delivery, someone randomly claiming they have one for you is a red flag.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To avoid this WhatsApp scam, never provide sensitive data, such as bank account info or credit card numbers, to anyone claiming they have a delivery for you.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Tips for Avoiding WhatsApp Scams</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h5>1. Don&rsquo;t Give Out Your Security Code to Anyone</h5>\n<p></p>\n<p>As we already mentioned, a WhatsApp code scam involves scammers asking you for a verification code to steal your account. Never send any code you receive through WhatsApp to anyone, even if they appear to be a contact of yours.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h5>2. Enable 2-Step Verification</h5>\n<p></p>\n<p>Two-step verification can be turned on in your WhatsApp account settings and adds an extra layer of security to prevent your account from getting hijacked.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h5>3. Be Vigilant</h5>\n<p></p>\n<p>Always be wary of messages you receive via WhatsApp. Even if you think they are from friends or family, they could be from scammers who have stolen one of your contact&rsquo;s accounts. Look out for messages that are unsolicited or seem off in any way.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h5>4. Call Your Friend/Family Member Directly When in Doubt</h5>\n<p></p>\n<p>If a friend or family member ever sends a message asking for some kind of personal info, call them and ask to make sure it was really them who sent the message.</p>\n",

            "content": "<h2>What Is Pretexting?</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Pretexting is when scammers gain access to sensitive data and personal accounts under false pretexts. They often contact their victims via phone calls, emails, and texts and work to gain their trust in order to get them to hand over private information.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Pretexting Is Social Engineering</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Social engineering is the act of deceiving or manipulating people into giving up confidential information. Thus, pretexting is a form of social engineering employed by scammers to obtain personal information for fraudulent reasons, such as to commit identity theft.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Pretexting in Cyber Security</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Pretexting is a big concern in the cyber security industry because scammers often favor digital means of communication, such as email, to lure their victims in.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A common technique online scammers use to pretext is to send phishing emails, which we&rsquo;ll go into a bit more detail about further down the page.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4 Examples of Pretexting</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h3>1. By Phone Call</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>In a voice call pretexting attack, the scammers call you up and pretend to represent some sort of legitimate company that needs some of your information under some false pretext.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For example, they might pretend to be a survey company and ask you for seemingly harmless details, such as the name of your children or pets.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/699aba4400c7d6812f2b46f45231780d.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/699aba4400c7d6812f2b46f45231780d.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"389\"></picture></p>\n<p></p>\n<h5>Why would scammers want access to this type of information, you ask?</h5>\n<p></p>\n<p>Well, they can use it to try to hack into your accounts or because they know many people use names of people or animals close to them as passwords. Or, they might try to call your financial institution and pretend to be you to gain access to your bank accounts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Pretexters can also sell whatever information they get from you to identity thieves, or perpetrate identity theft themselves. This type of voice call pretexting attack is also known as vishing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>2. By Text</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Text pretexting attacks work the same way as phone pretexting attacks, but the scammers send you text messages to try and get private information out of you under false pretexts.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>For example, they might send you a text claiming to be from your bank and ask you for your credit card or bank account number.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>3. By Identity Theft: The Boardroom Scandal at Hewlett-Packard</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>There was a case in 2006 that brought pretexting into the spotlight. HP&rsquo;s high-up management wanted to check if board members had been leaking confidential information to the press, so they hired a private investigator to get their phone records.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The private investigator used identity theft pretexting techniques to obtain board members&rsquo; personal data, such as social security numbers. He then used this information to impersonate them when talking to their phone companies in order to get access to their phone records.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is just one well-known example of the type of identity theft pretexting attacks that happen every day.t</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>4. Pretexting Phishing Attacks</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>As we mentioned a little earlier, a common way pretext attacks work online is through <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/5-common-tinder-scams-to-be-aware-of-in-2021/\">phishing emails</a>. This is when the scammers send emails that appear to be from legitimate companies you use and try to trick you into giving up account information or other sensitive data.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For instance, they might send you an email that looks like it&#8217;s from Amazon and claim that there is some type of problem with your account. They&rsquo;ll ask that you provide your username and password to troubleshoot the problem, which they will then use to enter your account and steal other information, like your credit card info that&rsquo;s stored there.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>How To Protect Yourself From Pretexting</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h3>1. Don&rsquo;t Give Out Personal Information Unless You Are 100% Sure It Is Safe</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>No matter what their pretexts are, you should never give out private information over the phone or via text or email if someone contacts you out of the blue. It&rsquo;s okay to do so if you call your bank or another company you use services from, but never trust anyone who contacts you in an unsolicited manner.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>2. Use as Unique Password as Possible, Your Child&rsquo;s Name Isn&rsquo;t Strong Enough</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Remember when we said that pretext attackers often phish for information like your children&rsquo;s or pet&rsquo;s names to try and impersonate you or hack into your accounts?</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Well, this is why you should always use complex, non-personal login passwords &mdash; this goes for verbal keywords for things like bank accounts, too. Add numbers and special characters to random words to <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/keep-your-money-and-personal-identity-safe-online/\"></a>ensure secure passwords.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/c17c5195dff8e2a55277b975bb42c7c3.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/c17c5195dff8e2a55277b975bb42c7c3.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"389\"></picture></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>3. Always Contact Your Bank Directly if You Think There Is an Issue</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>If anyone ever contacts you claiming to be from your bank, politely decline any requests for information they have. Then, call your bank directly and ask if there is some kind of real issue they are contacting you about. To be even more safe, you can always go to your bank in person and deal with any issues that way.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>4. Be Aware and Keep Your Wits About You</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>The number one way to avoid pretexting attacks and other scams is to always be wary and err on the side of caution. It&rsquo;s far better to be paranoid and overly careful than to let your guard down and get your identity stolen or wake up to find out your bank account has been drained.</p>\n",

            "content": "<p>Compared to other social media platforms, LinkedIn is a very safe platform, but are there scammers on LinkedIn? Unfortunately, yes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you use LinkedIn for professional networking and job hunting, it&rsquo;s important not to let your guard down and to know what types of LinkedIn scams are out there.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Why Do People Scam on LinkedIn?</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>Scammers know that people on LinkedIn are there to job hunt and network, so they&rsquo;re more likely to accept connection invitations and respond to messages from strangers.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Additionally, since LinkedIn has a good reputation as a highly professional social media platform, people are less likely to be suspicious of others who reach out to them on the site.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Is LinkedIn Really a Secure Platform?</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>LinkedIn itself is a very secure platform, and the majority of people using it are there for legitimate professional reasons. However, wherever there are potential victims, there will always be online scammers looking for their next target.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That being said, as long as you know what types of LinkedIn scams are out there and how to avoid them, there&rsquo;s no reason you should have any reservations about using the platform for your professional networking and job hunting needs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>6 of the Most Common LinkedIn Scams in 2022</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h3>1. Catfishing LinkedIn Scams</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Catfishing is something that can happen on any social media platform. On LinkedIn, catfishers pretend to be legitimate professionals, sometimes inventing fictional companies, to trick unsuspecting victims into giving them sensitive information.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For example, a catfisher might pretend to be a recruiter working for a reputable company, such as Amazon, Google, or Microsoft. They might target you because you are actively seeking employment and know how enticing a job at any of those companies would sound to you.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At some point during your communication with the scammers, they will probably ask you for sensitive data, perhaps your social security number, as part of the &ldquo;job application process.&rdquo; To avoid getting catfished on LinkedIn, never provide sensitive personal data over the network.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>2. Phishing LinkedIn Scams</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Phishing scams on LinkedIn are similar to catfishing scams on the platform, but the scammers might try to retrieve your sensitive data through other channels.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For example, they might ask for your email and start sending you emails that appear to be legitimate, but have malicious links or software in them. Or, they could give you a link to a site to fill out a &ldquo;job application,&rdquo; but the site is really fake and just designed to steal your personal info.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/6-common-phishing-scams-you-need-to-know-in-2021/\">Always research any companies or individuals</a> you think you&rsquo;re applying for a job with to make sure they&rsquo;re legit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>3. LinkedIn Job Scams</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>LinkedIn is full of fake or too-good-to-be-true job offers. One way LinkedIn job scams work is that scammers will claim that you&rsquo;ve been accepted for a job which you never actually applied for, and try to trick you into giving them sensitive personal data.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To avoid this, never accept any type of job offer which you have not applied for or gone through an interview process for.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Other LinkedIn frauds trick people, such as freelancers, into providing free work by requesting services with a promise to pay upon completion. Of course, once you hand over the work, the fraudsters disappear &mdash; they can just delete the profile they used to trick you and you won&rsquo;t ever see a dime.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/e6eb4d1e9e5f2646240763fdadc46ea8.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/e6eb4d1e9e5f2646240763fdadc46ea8.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"390\"></picture></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>4. &ldquo;Technical Error&rdquo; LinkedIn Scams</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is a type of LinkedIn password scam in which the <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/12-easy-ways-to-check-if-a-website-is-legit-or-a-scam/\">scammers send you emails</a> that appear to be from LinkedIn support and claim that there is some kind of technical issue with your account. They try to get you to provide them with your LinkedIn login details, which they can use to steal your account and other personal data stored there.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>5. Malicious Software LinkedIn Scams</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Another common way online scammers try to steal from you is by getting you to install malicious software, such as malware or ransomware, on your device. They might send you a file download link or a website URL that they want you to click on under pretenses that appear legitimate, but the link really installs malicious software on your computer.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To avoid this type of LinkedIn scam, never click on unsolicited links from strangers, unless you know they are legitimate (i.e., links to real company sites). Also, you should always install anti-malware and virus protection software on your device and keep it up to date to stay protected.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>6. Advance Fee Schemes</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Advance fee scams are another common type of online scam that can occur on LinkedIn. In this type of scam, the fraudsters will make a promise that&rsquo;s too good to be true about how you can invest a small amount of money in something to get huge returns.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For example, they might ask you to invest in a startup or in some type of cryptocurrency. However, once you hand over your money, they ghost you and you never get anything back.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To avoid advance fee LinkedIn frauds, never send money to anyone you connect with on the platform and be wary of any offers that sound too good to be true &mdash; because they probably are.</p>\n",

            "content": "<h2>How do binary options signals work?</h2>\n<p>Binary options signals are a type of alert that investors can choose to receive from a binary options trading platform in order to make decisions about which binary options to buy and sell. The most common way you can sign up to receive binary options signals alerts is through a binary options signals broker service.</p>\n<h3>What are binary options signals brokers?</h3>\n<p>Binary options signals brokers are binary options trading platforms allegedly run by investment professionals, who you can buy binary options signals plans from. Once you sign up for their services and pay, the brokers send you alerts about trades to make that will supposedly make you good returns on your investments.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there are many <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/blacklisted-brands/\">scam brokers</a> out there, who do not provide reliable trading advice and end up scamming you out of your funds. Some scam brokers even employ binary options trading signal bots, which are even less reliable because they use very rudimental technology to give you advice about what trades to make.</p>\n<h2>Binary options signal scams</h2>\n<h3>What are the types of signal scams?</h3>\n<p>One common way that scam brokers defraud people of their money is by refusing to give you your funds. A broker may seem completely legitimate, but when you go to withdraw your original deposit or your returns from your account, you can&rsquo;t. The platform&rsquo;s customer service may offer unsatisfactory explanations for why you can&rsquo;t take your money out, or they might just ignore you altogether.</p>\n<p>Another even more sneaky way that binary options signal scammers can steal from you is through identity theft. Once you sign up for a fake binary options signal service, the scammers can use your sensitive data to steal directly from you (via<a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/best-credit-card-fraud-detection-techniques/\"> credit cards</a>), or they can sell the data off to other even more shady parties.</p>\n<p>The third most common type of binary options signal scam is data manipulation. A scam trading platform might manipulate the data to make it look like you made a losing trade in order to keep your deposited funds, with you none the wiser. Or, they might only slightly manipulate the numbers to make your returns look lower than they are, keeping a percentage of the profits themselves.</p>\n<h3>How to know if you&rsquo;ve been scammed by binary options signals</h3>\n<p>If you are unable to withdraw funds from a binary options trading platform after signing up for a binary options trading signals plan, you have likely been scammed. Or, if you were promised certain returns on your investments and are not receiving anywhere near those returns (i.e., you keep making losing trades), the broker you signed up for is likely scamming you.</p>\n<h3>How to avoid signal scams</h3>\n<p>One of the biggest red flags to watch out for to avoid binary options signal scams is any promise that sounds too good to be true. Many scammers overstate (or completely lie) about the return on investment you can expect by signing up for their signals platforms.</p>\n<p>Another great way to avoid getting scammed is to do thorough research on any binary signal brokers that you&rsquo;re considering signing up with. Unregistered brokers are the biggest perpetrators of scams, so always make sure that any broker platform you want to use is registered and doesn&rsquo;t have a history of fraud.</p>\n<p>If you can&rsquo;t verify that a broker is registered, or you come across any reports of negative experiences from other investors, don&rsquo;t give any money to that broker. There are plenty of legitimate options signals platforms out there that you can use &mdash; just do your due diligence to choose a reputable platform.</p>\n<p>Lastly, it&rsquo;s always good to sign up for services that offer trial periods. That way, you can test them out without committing too much in order to prove that they work and that they aren&rsquo;t a scam.</p>\n<h2>What to do if you&rsquo;re scammed by binary options signals?</h2>\n<p>If you suspect you&rsquo;ve been scammed out of your hard-earned money by a binary options signals scam, don&rsquo;t despair. You can still hire a funds recovery specialist, such as Payback, to take on your case and try to get your <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/i-was-scammed-on-binary-options-how-do-i-get-my-money-back/\">money back from the binary options broker</a>.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/79e505cee7f941ce016c68285431f0e5.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/79e505cee7f941ce016c68285431f0e5.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"389\"></picture></p>\n<p>The first thing to do if you get scammed by a binary options signals broker is to immediately stop using the service.

Keep reading to find out what some of the most prevalent Marketplace scams are.</p>\n<h2>5 Common Facebook Marketplace scams</h2>\n<h3>1. Facebook Marketplace shipping scams</h3>\n<p>In Facebook Marketplace shipping scams, the buyer or seller (depending on what side of the sale your on) will try to get you to either agree to pay for an item that they promise to ship to you, or try to get you to ship them an item you&rsquo;re selling that they promise to pay for upon receipt. Of course, the scammers will either never ship you the item you paid for, or never pay you for the item you shipped them.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, this Facebook Marketplace scam is super easy to avoid. If you&rsquo;re a buyer, never pay for an item in advance and never agree to receive an item in the post. If you&rsquo;re a seller, never agree to ship an item to a buyer and always make sure to receive the money at the same time you hand an item over to a buyer.</p>\n<h3>2. Facebook Marketplace PayPal scams</h3>\n<p>PayPal is a legitimate payment method for Facebook Marketplace transactions, and PayPal payments are protected by Facebook&rsquo;s and PayPal&rsquo;s Purchase Protection policies. BUT, the protection policies only cover regular PayPal payments &mdash; NOT payments you send using PayPal&rsquo;s &ldquo;friends and family&rdquo; payment option.</p>\n<p>In Facebook Marketplace <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/the-most-common-paypal-scams-and-how-to-get-your-money-back/\">PayPal scams</a>, the scammers may try to get you to pay them as &ldquo;friends and family,&rdquo; using the excuse that they want to avoid the fees PayPal charges on regular payments.</p>\n<p>These types of scammers might sell you fake or defective items, but by the time you realize it and the sellers are long gone, it&rsquo;s too late. Since you made a friends and family payment, your purchase isn&rsquo;t protected and you won&rsquo;t be able to get a refund.</p>\n<h3>3. Facebook Marketplace car scams</h3>\n<p>You might be able to find a great deal on a second-hand car on Facebook, but you should never put a deposit down on one. This is because there are lots of scammers out there perpetrating Facebook Marketplace car scams, in which they create fake posts about cars they&#8217;re selling and ask for a small deposit from interested buyers to &ldquo;hold the car&rdquo; for them.</p>\n<p>The sellers then provide an address for you to meet them at and pick up your new car, but the address is either fake or the car and seller are nowhere to be seen and your deposit is long gone.</p>\n<h3>4. Facebook Marketplace fake buyers</h3>\n<p>There are a few different kinds of <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/7-red-flags-to-look-out-for-to-not-get-scammed-on-facebook-marketplace/\">Facebook Marketplace fake buyers</a> you should be on the lookout for. For example, there are fake buyers who might try to get you to send them something you&rsquo;re selling and promise to pay you when they receive it, but then never actually send you any money (see Facebook Marketplace shipping scams above).</p>\n<p>There are also fake buyers who use Facebook Marketplace to commit in-person robberies. They agree to buy something from you and ask to meet up in a secluded place, then steal the item you&rsquo;re selling and anything else of value you have on you.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/17a149ce6cccf36fd4973cc52599d44a.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/17a149ce6cccf36fd4973cc52599d44a.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"843\"></picture></p>\n<p>To avoid getting robbed by a fake buyer on Facebook Marketplace, always do transactions in person, in a public, brightly-lit area with lots of other people around. For maximum security, ask buyers to meet you in front of a police station or somewhere where cops hang out and are visible.</p>\n<h3>5. Facebook Marketplace fake sellers</h3>\n<p>There are also a variety of <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/7-red-flags-to-look-out-for-to-not-get-scammed-on-facebook-marketplace/\">Facebook Marketplace fake sellers</a>. They might run the same types of scams as fake buyers that we mentioned above (shipping scams or robbery), or they might be selling bootleg items or items that don&rsquo;t work or aren&rsquo;t in the condition advertised.</p>\n<p>To avoid making a purchase that you regret, always inspect the item you&rsquo;re buying thoroughly before you hand over any money to make sure it&rsquo;s real and in good working order.</p>\n<h2>Who are the victims of Facebook Marketplace scams?</h2>\n<p>Anyone who uses Facebook Marketplace is at risk of falling victim to a Facebook Marketplace scam. Young kids, teenagers, and the elderly may be more at risk because they aren&rsquo;t as familiar with the platform and with online scams in general.</p>\n<h2>How to report a scam on Facebook Marketplace</h2>\n<p>There are two main ways to report a scam on Facebook Marketplace. See the instructions below to report either a buyer&rsquo;s or seller&rsquo;s Facebook Marketplace scam.</p>\n<h3>How to report a buyer scam on Facebook Marketplace:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Click &ldquo;Marketplace&rdquo; in the menu</li>\n<li>Click &ldquo;Your Account&rdquo;</li>\n<li>Click &ldquo;Your Listings&rdquo;</li>\n<li>Click your listing that you want to report a scam buyer for</li>\n<li>Go to the messages between you and the buyer (or click &ldquo;See More&rdquo;)</li>\n<li>Click &ldquo;Report Buyer&rdquo;</li>\n<li>Follow the on-screen instructions to report the buyer</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>How to report a seller scam on Facebook Marketplace:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Click &ldquo;Marketplace&rdquo; in the menu</li>\n<li>Click the seller&rsquo;s listing</li>\n<li>Scroll down and click the seller&rsquo;s profile name</li>\n<li>Click &ldquo;Report&rdquo;</li>\n<li>Choose the option that best explains why you&rsquo;re reporting them</li>\n<li>Follow the remaining on-screen instructions to finish reporting the buyer</li>\n</ol>\n",

You might feel like all is lost, but there are things you can do to minimize the impact. Follow the steps below as soon as you realize you&rsquo;ve been scammed to avoid losing any more money and report the scammers to protect yourself and others.</p>\n<h3>Step 1: Stop All Contact with the Scammers</h3>\n<p>The first thing to do when you get scammed is to immediately cease any and all contact you have with them &mdash; and don&rsquo;t give them any more money.</p>\n<p>Scammers will string you along as far as they can with promises that you&rsquo;ll get your money back after just one more deposit and things like that.</p>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t reply to any further emails, calls, social media messages, or texts from the scammers, and block them from contacting you wherever possible.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Don&rsquo;t Panic, Take Action</h3>\n<p>It&rsquo;s perfectly normal to feel distraught and hopeless after you lose money to scammers, but the sooner you take action, the better your chances are of recovering at least some of your money.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s very important to follow the next steps to prevent scammers from stealing any more of your hard-earned funds, especially if they have hold of your credit card or bank info or other sensitive data that could be used to perpetrate identity theft.</p>\n<h3>Step 3: Gather the Evidence</h3>\n<p>The next thing you need to do before you report a scammer is gather all the evidence you have of the scam. This can include bank and credit card statements with deposits and transactions you made, as well as all communications you have with the scammers.</p>\n<p>For example, let&rsquo;s say you deposited funds to a <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/blacklisted-brands/\">fraudulent investment broker</a>, then realized you were scammed when you couldn&rsquo;t withdraw your funds and their &ldquo;customer service&rdquo; ignored your messages. To gather the evidence for such a case, download copies of your financial records showing the dates and sums of all the payments you made, then save copies of all the emails you sent to the scammers and received no response to.</p>\n<p>This is just one example of the type of evidence you can use. If you have social media messages or texts from the scammers on your phone, screenshot them and save the pictures somewhere safe so you don&rsquo;t accidentally delete or lose them.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, gathering as much evidence as you can will significantly increase your odds of a positive outcome, so no detail is too small.</p>\n<h3>Step 4: Call Your Bank Straight Away</h3>\n<p>Now that you have all the evidence of the scam, you&rsquo;ll want to contact your bank right away. If there is a transaction that hasn&rsquo;t been finalized yet, you can try to have your bank cancel or put a hold on the transaction to prevent it from going through.</p>\n<p>If the scammers have your bank account or credit card info, you should ask the bank to close your account and transfer your funds to a new one, or cancel your credit card and send you a replacement. This will prevent the scammers from stealing any more from you.</p>\n<p>If you have already made payments to scammers via your credit card, you can present the evidence to your bank (or credit card provider) and ask them to <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/a-guide-to-chargebacks-recover-your-funds-after-a-scam/\">do a chargeback</a>, which means they reverse the charge and the funds go back to your card as if the transaction never happened.</p>\n<h3>Step 5: Report the Scammer</h3>\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to report scams to the proper authorities to help protect yourself and others in the community. How do I report a scammer, you ask? Well, it works a little differently in every country, but below you will find out some country-specific processes, as well as some more general tips for reporting scammers.</p>\n<h2>Where To Report a Scammer in the USA</h2>\n<h3>Call the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Agency</h3>\n<p>In the United States, you can report a scammer to the FTC.

            "content": "<p>When it comes to scams, you might primarily be concerned about<a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/protect-yourself-from-common-online-scams/\"> online scams</a> or<a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/stock-trading-scams/\"> investment scams</a>. However, there&rsquo;s another common type of scam that you should be on the lookout for as well: real estate scams.</p>\n<p>There are many different types of real estate scams that you can fall victim to, so it&rsquo;s important to know what some of the most popular are and how to spot them.</p>\n<h2>Top 5 Real Estate Scams in 2022 ( &amp; How To Spot Them)&nbsp;</h2>\n<h3>1. Wire Transfer Scam</h3>\n<p>In a real estate wire transfer scam, the fraudsters target people in the process of buying homes. They typically pose as escrow companies to trick unsuspecting home buyers into wiring them escrow funds, which they then transfer to a different offshore account before they disappear into the wind.</p>\n<h4>How To Spot a Wire Transfer Scam</h4>\n<p>Scammers often trick people into believing they represent a legitimate escrow company using spoofing tactics. What this means is that they create websites, phone numbers, and email addresses that are almost identical to the real escrow company. They might simply change 1 digit in a phone number or add 1 letter to an email address or URL.</p>\n<p>To avoid this type of real estate scam, always double check any communications you receive from escrow companies and look for inconsistencies or anything that looks off. Also, never wire transfer any money without verifying details of the transfer over the phone with someone you&rsquo;ve already spoken to or in person.</p>\n<h3>2. Deed Fraud</h3>\n<p>Deed fraud, also known as home title fraud, is when scammers illegally obtain the deed or title to a property. They often pose as real estate agents to obtain sensitive information and falsify documents to steal ownership of an unoccupied home. Once they have obtained ownership of a home, these fraudsters may rent it out or try to sell it to another unsuspecting victim.</p>\n<h4>How To Spot a Deed Fraud</h4>\n<p>Some red flags to watch out for that might mean you have become the victim of deed fraud are notices of unpaid utility bills (because scammers change the address they get sent to), a notice of foreclosure, or evidence of someone living in a vacant property you own.</p>\n<h3>3. Loan Flipping</h3>\n<p>Loan flipping is when ill-intentioned lenders aggressively persuade homeowners to refinance their mortgage over and over again and try to get them to take out bigger loans over time. These scammers charge high fees and homeowners who fall for their ploys can end up with loans that are too big to ever pay off.</p>\n<h4>How To Spot Loan Flipping</h4>\n<p>If you are not actively searching for a mortgage loan, but lenders are contacting you repeatedly to try and persuade you to refinance, this can be a sign of a loan flipping scam. This is especially true if you recently refinanced your home. It&rsquo;s almost never a good idea to refinance your home multiple times in a row in quick succession.</p>\n<h3>4. Foreclosure Relief</h3>\n<p>Foreclosure relief scammers typically access public records of homes in pre-foreclosure processes to find their victims. They target people who are desperate to not go into foreclosure and offer them foreclosure relief, promising that they can drastically reduce their mortgage payments in exchange for a large lump sum.</p>\n<h4>How To Spot Foreclosure Relief Scams</h4>\n<p>Foreclosure relief scammers sometimes pose as government or social housing authorities, or claim they have talked to your mortgage company, which isn&rsquo;t true. Be wary of anyone making offers that sound too good to be true about helping you save your home from foreclosure.</p>\n<h3>5. Rental Scams</h3>\n<p>In rental scams, fraudsters post fake rental ads for properties that they don&rsquo;t actually own or manage. They often steal real information and pictures from existing ads to make their fake ads more convincing and lure in interested renters.</p>\n<p>Once they have a potential renter on the hook, they ask for a deposit for them to see the house or hold the property for them. Once they get the money, they disappear and the would-be renters never actually get to see the property.</p>\n<h4>How To Spot A Rental Scam</h4>\n<p>The easiest way to spot and avoid rental scams is to not trust anyone who asks for money up front, before they even show you a rental property. Any legitimate landlord should be willing to show you the property before you enter into any negotiations about money.</p>\n<h2>What To Do If You&rsquo;ve Been Scammed</h2>\n<h3>How To Report a Scam</h3>\n<p>The process for reporting real estate scams varies from country to country. For instance, in the United States, you can report a real estate scam to local law enforcement or to the FBI. In the UK, you can report property fraud to Action Fraud, the National Fraud and Cyber Crime Reporting Centre.</p>\n<p>In most other countries, reporting real estate scams to your local law enforcement is a good place to start. If there is another place you should be reporting it as well, they will point you in the right direction.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re not sure how to report a real estate scam in your country, you can find more information by Googling something like &ldquo;where to report real estate scams in,&rdquo; followed by the name of the country.</p>\n",

            "content": "<p>South Korean Netflix Series <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10919420/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Squid Game</a> was released in September 2021, and crypto scammers were quick to take advantage of the trending show to take advantage of unsuspecting investors.</p>\n<h2>The Story Behind the Newest Crypto on the Block</h2>\n<p>The SQUID cryptocurrency appeared on the market at the end of October 2021, and was marketed as a &ldquo;play-to-earn&rdquo; cryptocurrency. This means that investors can buy crypto tokens and use them in online games to earn more tokens, which in theory can be traded for other cryptocurrencies or real money. This wasn&rsquo;t quite the case with SQUID.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/f111b8fe99db35024c0525a2e4d166dc.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/f111b8fe99db35024c0525a2e4d166dc.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"389\"></picture></p>\n<p>SQUID creators alleged that investors would be able to use the cryptocurrency in a game inspired by the Netflix series, a game that wasn&rsquo;t yet live. With all the hype surrounding it, SQUID&rsquo;s value shot up from around just 1 cent to almost $2,900 in less than a week.</p>\n<p>However, it wasn&rsquo;t long before investors realized they were unable to sell the tokens they purchased, and the platform completely shut down all trading activities &mdash; the scammers had made off with approximately $3.38 million in funds, and the cryptocurrency immediately lost 99.99% of its value.</p>\n<p>This <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/17-cryptocurrency-investment-scams-you-must-know-about/\">type of crypto scam</a> is known as a &ldquo;rug pull.&rdquo; In these types of scams, the developers of cryptocurrencies promote them heavily, wait until prices are highly inflated, then suddenly pull out and take all of the money invested with them, leaving duped investors high and dry.</p>\n<h2>Red Flags That Should Have Been Spotted</h2>\n<p>The biggest red flag for the Squid-Game-inspired cryptocurrency was that you couldn&rsquo;t sell tokens after buying them. This one is pretty obvious, but it&rsquo;s something that most investors only realized after they&rsquo;d already bought into SQUID.</p>\n<p>Another red flag that should have tipped investors off to a potential scam before buying any SQUID tokens was the website for the project. It was full of spelling mistakes and grammatical errors, which indicated it had been thrown together quickly and without attention to detail.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the fake company&rsquo;s Telegram channel didn&rsquo;t allow any outside comments, and its Twitter account didn&rsquo;t allow replies to any posts. These were both signs that the SQUID developers had something to hide.</p>\n<h2>So, Have Investors Learned Their Lesson?</h2>\n<p>The problem with the crypto space is that it&rsquo;s very hard to tell the difference between <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/is-cryptocurrency-legit-legal-issues-of-unconventional-currencies/\">legitimate and scam cryptocurrencies</a>, and there is no centralized authority regulating cryptocurrencies to weed out scammers.</p>\n<p>So, as long as there are people willing to put their trust, and money, into the crypto market, there will always be opportunities for scammers to take advantage of investors with fake cryptocurrencies and rug pull scams, like the Squid Game token scam.</p>\n<p>Perhaps stories like this one will make investors think twice the next time they&rsquo;re considering investing in a new cryptocurrency. But, no matter what, you&rsquo;re always taking a risk when you put money into any type of crypto. So, there will likely always be investors willing to take big risks in the hopes of making big returns quickly by investing in tokens that might turn out to be scams.</p>\n<h2>How To Spot Fake Cryptocurrencies</h2>\n<p>Scammers like to use pop culture to attract investors to their fake cryptocurrencies. They create so-called &ldquo;meme tokens&rdquo; that draw on popular memes, shows, and other cultural hits of the moment to build up hype and get investments, then disappear with the money.</p>\n<p>For example, there was another recent rug pull scam in which the scammers created a Mando token inspired by Disney&rsquo;s The Mandalorian and marketed it using images from the popular series. There is also a Marvel token, inspired by Marvel Comics, that is likely a scam.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s not to say that all pop-culture-inspired tokens are necessarily scams or that there aren&rsquo;t other types of scam tokens, but it&rsquo;s something to be aware of.</p>\n<p>Of course, the biggest red flag that we already mentioned is if you are unable to sell a cryptocurrency you invested in. If you&rsquo;re considering buying a new token, do some research first to see if you can find out what type of experiences other people who&rsquo;ve already bought it are having with selling.</p>\n<p>If crypto companies have their comments and replies turned off on social media, this can be a sign that they are trying to make it harder to find out whether or not the cryptocurrency is legit, so think twice about investing in any token company that doesn&rsquo;t allow outside social media comments.</p>\n<h2>Getting Your Money Back from a Crypto Scam</h2>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve fallen victim to a cryptocurrency scam, all may not be lost. There are ways to get your money back from scammers, even if it seems they have completely disappeared with your funds.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/\">Payback LTD</a> is a scam funds recovery company specializing in <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/cryptocurrency-scams/\">getting your money back from crypto scams</a> and all types of online scams.

However, it&rsquo;s important to know what to look for to protect yourself from fraudulent buyers and sellers, because you can get scammed on Facebook Marketplace. To learn more about the types of scams check out the most <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/common-facebook-marketplace-scams/\">common Facebook Marketplace scams</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>7 Red Flags to Watch Out for to Not Get Scammed on Facebook Marketplace</h2>\n<h3>1. Low prices offered for expensive, in-demand items</h3>\n<p>When a deal sounds too good to be true, it usually is. For example, if the latest video game console is out of stock everywhere, but you see it listed on Facebook for less than the retail price, it&rsquo;s probably a scam.</p>\n<h3>2. The seller asks to meet at your house</h3>\n<p>There&rsquo;s no reason a seller would need to meet you at your house instead of somewhere public, unless they&rsquo;re up to no good. Always make Facebook Marketplace transactions in public places with other people around.</p>\n<h3>3. The seller&rsquo;s profile looks surprisingly fake</h3>\n<p>If the seller has a fake looking picture and no normal activity on their profile, it&rsquo;s likely a false account that they opened just to scam people. If you have any doubts about a profile, trust your gut.</p>\n<h3>4. The seller asks for an unusual payment method</h3>\n<p>Legitimate sellers have no reason to ask for payments in gift cards, cryptocurrency, or any other unconventional form of payment. You should always pay using cash or instant transfers.</p>\n<h3>5. You are not allowed to see the item before purchasing</h3>\n<p>It&rsquo;s completely normal to want to see an item before you hand over the money, so if the seller refuses to let you inspect it, they&rsquo;re probably hiding something. Only buy items that you can verify the authenticity and quality of.</p>\n<h3>6. The seller directs you to another website to communicate</h3>\n<p>Some fraudsters hack real peoples&rsquo; Facebook accounts to communicate with their targets, so they want to avoid using messenger in order to not raise suspicion. Only negotiate purchases via Facebook Messenger to ensure accountability.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/2f3a442f1463573d301329a9aed1e0c7.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/2f3a442f1463573d301329a9aed1e0c7.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"437\"></picture></p>\n<h3>7. The seller has been noted for fraud elsewhere online</h3>\n<p>Before you commit to buying an item, Google the seller&rsquo;s name and email address to see if they have been called out for another scam on Facebook Marketplace or anywhere else online. If anything comes up, you know not to trust that seller!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>For Sellers: How To Know if Your Buyer Is a Scammer?</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h3>1. They send you a code to verify your identity</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Some Facebook Marketplace scammers use this trick to set up a fraudulent Google Voice account, which they can use to scam other people. There&rsquo;s no reason you would need to verify any code to make a sale on Facebook Marketplace.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>2. The buyer wants to communicate on another platform</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Scam buyers are often eager to communicate via other means where there is less traceability and accountability. Keep all your Marketplace negotiations with buyers on the Facebook Messenger platform.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>3. They refuse to meet you in a public place</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>If a buyer doesn&rsquo;t want to meet you publicly, it might be because they don&rsquo;t want any witnesses or cameras around. Always make Facebook Marketplace transactions in public places. If you&rsquo;re uncomfortable, you can even ask buyers to meet you near a police station for extra security.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What Happens if You Get Scammed on Facebook Marketplace?</h2>\n<h3>Report the scam</h3>\n<p>To report a scam on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/196126404168290\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook Marketplace</a>, just click on the buyer&rsquo;s or seller&rsquo;s name, click on the 3 dots that come up, and click on &ldquo;Report Buyer&rdquo; or &ldquo;Report Seller.&rdquo; Next, follow the on-screen instructions to file the report with Facebook.</p>\n<h3>Facebook Purchase Protection</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/228307904608701\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook Purchase Protection</a> is automatically offered on certain types of products, so if you get scammed, you might be eligible for a refund.

There are many ways scammers can &ldquo;phish&rdquo; for your personal info, but one of the most common strategies is to send out an email that appears to be from Instagram itself.</p>\n<p>These Instagram email scam artists typically claim that your account is locked or that you need to verify it in order to continue using the platform and prompt you to click on a link to reset your password or provide your login info. Of course, the email is fake and the link really takes you to some third-party site that steals your data.</p>\n<h3>2. Instagram DM scams</h3>\n<p>Instagram phishing isn&rsquo;t just limited to emails. Scammers will also slide into your DMs to try and trick you into giving up sensitive information. They can even use bots to try and pry details out of you during seemingly real conversations.</p>\n<h3>3. Instagram money scams</h3>\n<p>There are a variety of Instagram scams that try to get you to send money somewhere under false pretenses. For instance, there are fake influencers who claim to know the secret to making a lot of money fast by investing. They&rsquo;ll ask you to deposit money with them, promising too-good-to-be-true returns, then disappear with your funds. This is common in <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/instagram-bitcoin-scams-dangerous-truth-2021/\">Bitcoin Instagram scams.</a></p>\n<p>Alternatively, scammers might try and trick you into thinking you&rsquo;ve won some kind of giveaway, and all you need to do to claim the prize is enter your credit card or bank account info. Then, they use this info to steal money from you.</p>\n<h3>4. Catfish scams on Instagram</h3>\n<p>Catfish scams are a type of Instagram romance scam in which the fraudsters pose as a natural person, often using real photos and info stolen from elsewhere online and try to make you fall in love with them.</p>\n<p>Then, when you&rsquo;re comfortable and let your guard down, they start asking you to send them money for bills, gifts, or some other reason. Of course, you&rsquo;re not really talking to who you think you are, and the scammers will just keep draining your wallet until you catch on.</p>\n<h3>5. Instagram ad scams</h3>\n<p>There are many legitimate ads and products for sale on Instagram, but scammers trick you into purchasing things that never materialize. For example, you might notice a bunch of ads for a &ldquo;clearance&rdquo; sale on a fashion brand, and it looks like there are great deals, so you click on the ads to go to a third-party shopping site.</p>\n<p>However, when you buy clothes from the site, they never arrive, and you can&rsquo;t contact any sort of customer service to get a refund. These Instagram ad scams are also known as Instagram promotion scams.</p>\n<h2>Who Are the Victims of Instagram Scams?</h2>\n<p>There are so many different common Instagram scams that almost anyone can fall victim to one. For example, if you use the platform for shopping, you might fall for an Instagram ad scam. Or, if you&rsquo;re using Instagram for dating, you could easily be catfished and tricked into a romance scam.</p>\n<p>However, the most vulnerable people are those who don&rsquo;t know what to watch out for to avoid Instagram scams. We&rsquo;ll provide some tips below to help keep yourself safe on Instagram.</p>\n<h2>How To Report an Instagram Scammer</h2>\n<p>To report a scam account on Instagram, click on the three dots in the upper right-hand corner of the profile and click on &ldquo;Report.&rdquo; Then, follow the on-screen instructions to report the account for scamming.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Staying Safe on Instagram</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Follow these tips to avoid Instagram scams:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Don&rsquo;t click on any suspicious links (even from friends or family)</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Never send money to anyone who asks via Instagram</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Be wary of unverified business accounts</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Don&rsquo;t respond to messages from anyone claiming to work for Instagram</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Don&rsquo;t click on email links asking you to verify or unlock your account</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Don&rsquo;t provide personal info or send money to claim a prize</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Don&rsquo;t trust information from people whose messages or posts are misspelled</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Be wary of any offers or promises that sound too good to be true</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Make your account private if you don&rsquo;t need it to be public for any reason</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Call people you know to see if they&rsquo;ve been hacked if you get a weird message from them</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you keep your wits about you and don&rsquo;t blindly trust every account you interact with on Instagram, it&rsquo;s a perfectly safe platform to use. However, it&rsquo;s important to be aware of the risks that are out there and know what to look out for to avoid common Instagram scams. Keep an eye out for red flags and follow the tips above to keep yourself safe.</p>\n",

            "content": "<h2>The Growth of Snapchat</h2>\n<p>Snapchat, the social media app best known for its vanishing images and videos, was launched in 2011 but didn&rsquo;t really become popular until about 2013. What made Snapchat blow up so quickly, even with so many other social media platforms to compete against, was that theoretically, nothing users sent or uploaded could come back to haunt them.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/afeca48dcc60722f821e1e4714ce888d.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/afeca48dcc60722f821e1e4714ce888d.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"389\"></picture></p>\n<p>The app was especially popular among teens, who wanted to share content away from the prying eyes of their parents and teachers. Because of the disappearing nature of &ldquo;Snaps,&rdquo; or Snapchat posts, it also quickly gained notoriety as a sexting app.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to 2021, and Snapchat now has approximately 293 million daily active users. And, unfortunately, on any platform with so many users, there are also scammers targeting them. Though Snapchat has plenty of legitimate users and content, it&rsquo;s important to know what to look out for to avoid Snapchat scams.</p>\n<h2>4 Most Common Snapchat Scams</h2>\n<h3>1. Snapchat premium scam</h3>\n<p>One of the most common Snapchat scams involves accounts that post images and videos of girls in bikinis or sexually suggestive poses, then ask users to pay them for &ldquo;premium&rdquo; content of the girls fully nude or performing sex acts.</p>\n<p>The Snapchat scammers ask for cash payments via Cash App or other popular mobile payment services and rarely deliver the content they promised (though they might continue to send you &ldquo;teasers&rdquo; and request more money).</p>\n<h3>2. Snapchat meetup scams</h3>\n<p>Snapchat meetup scams are similar to Snapchat premium scams, except that, instead of promising to provide adult content, the scammers offer to meet up with you if you pay large amounts of money.</p>\n<p>The scammers typically pose as &ldquo;models&rdquo; and trick unsuspecting users into transferring them money or even providing their credit card numbers in exchange for an in-person date, which never happens.</p>\n<h3>3. Snapchat sex scam</h3>\n<p>Snapchat sex scams are another type of scam on the platform that preys on users looking for adult content online. In this case, the scammers claim they want to talk to you via a different dating site, for which they provide the link.</p>\n<p>Once you visit the site, you&rsquo;ll be prompted to enter your credit card info or otherwise make a payment to sign up for the service and be able to chat and see videos. Of course, once you hand over the cash, the scammers disappear.</p>\n<h3>4. Snapchat catfish scam</h3>\n<p>In a Snapchat catfish scam, also known as Snapchat romance scams, accounts upload photos and videos of good-looking people and trick users into thinking they&rsquo;re talking with the person in the images. The scammers try to make you feel like you have a real romantic connection with the person you think you&rsquo;re talking to, then start asking you for money.</p>\n<h3>5. Snapchat account recovery scam</h3>\n<p>The fifth most common type of Snapchat scam involves scammers who pose as someone you know or as someone from Snapchat and try to trick you into giving them sensitive information.</p>\n<p>For instance, they might pretend to be a friend of yours and claim that they are locked out of their account because they can&rsquo;t remember their username. They then ask you to give them your login info so they can go look for their account.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, scammers might send you an email that appears to be from Snapchat and ask you for your login info to unlock your account.</p>\n<p>Once they have your info, they change your password and hold your account hostage until you pay them a certain amount of money.</p>\n<h2>Who Are the Victims of Snapchat Scams?</h2>\n<p>On average, Snapchat has a younger user base than many other social media platforms, so victims of Snapchat scams are often teens and young adults.</p>\n<p>As you can see from the types of Snapchat scams we described above, scammers also often target vulnerable users looking for adult content or romantic connections on the platform.</p>\n<h3>Staying Safe on Snapchat</h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Don&rsquo;t open emails that claim your Snapchat account is locked, and don&rsquo;t click on links in them if you do</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Don&rsquo;t look for dates or online romances on Snapchat</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Never send money to anyone you meet via Snapchat</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Don&rsquo;t pay for access to premium content or sign up for sites you are linked to via Snapchat</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Don&rsquo;t click on any unknown links you get sent on Snapchat</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Check with friends to make sure they weren&rsquo;t hacked if you start to receive any messages from their accounts asking you for sensitive info</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Block any accounts that seem off or ask you for personal info</li>\n</ul>\n",

            "content": "<p>In the world of forex trading, there are a wide variety of scams that target inexperienced investors and trick them out of their money. One such scam is called a forex pyramid scheme.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in trading forex, it&rsquo;s important to know what to look out for to keep yourself &mdash; and your money &mdash; safe from forex scammers.</p>\n<h2>What Qualifies as a Pyramid Scheme?</h2>\n<p>In general terms, a pyramid scheme is a form of investment scam in which each person involved recruits paying participants into the scheme, with the people at each level of the &ldquo;pyramid&rdquo; making more money than those below them.</p>\n<p>The person who starts a pyramid scheme sits at the top of the pyramid, getting paid by everyone else who joins the program, while everyone underneath them continues to recruit more and more participants, growing the pyramid and the amount of money involved.</p>\n<p>Participants of pyramid schemes are usually tricked into paying in order to join a program that will allow them to make money through some form of legitimate business, but really they are just getting money from the people under them that get recruited. A pyramid scheme is also known as a multi-level marketing scheme.</p>\n<p>Read more in our <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/identify-and-avoid-pyramid-schemes/\">Pyramid Scheme Guide</a></p>\n<h2>Is Forex Considered a Pyramid Scheme?</h2>\n<p>Forex trading itself is a legitimate way to make money by buying and selling international currencies on a 100% legal market, so it is not a pyramid scheme. However, wherever there is a lot of money involved, there are scammers looking to take advantage of vulnerable investors.</p>\n<p>Forex pyramid schemes do exist, and target inexperienced, often young, investors who are looking for exciting ways to start trading and make a lot of money fast.</p>\n<p>Forex pyramid schemes typically offer forex-related products and services, such as training courses and videos, in exchange for money from program participants. The scammers then push all the participants to recruit new paying members and provide small monetary rewards or other incentives for doing so.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/034eb2a03fef797edb78cb73bddd8ab3.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/034eb2a03fef797edb78cb73bddd8ab3.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"389\"></picture></p>\n<p>So, in short, is forex a pyramid scheme? No. BUT, forex trading can be used to manipulate enthusiastic new investors into joining a pyramid or multi-level marketing scheme.</p>\n<h2>3 Important Red Flags To Look For:</h2>\n<h3>1. Too-good-to-be-true guarantees of huge returns</h3>\n<p>With any type of investment scam, the biggest red flag is someone promising you a huge return on your investment. Forex pyramid scammers preach about &ldquo;living the dream&rdquo; and how forex trading can give you complete financial freedom and enough money to do anything or go anywhere you want to.</p>\n<p>These types of promises and guarantees are simply not true. Any type of trading and investing takes a lot of time and commitment to get good at, and there is no such thing as a magic formula to &ldquo;get rich quick.&rdquo;</p>\n<h3>2. Required purchases of products</h3>\n<p>Another bright red flag that&rsquo;s a sure sign of a forex pyramid scheme is when you have to purchase some kind of product to join a program. You might be pressured into paying for access to training videos and courses, or for some type of information from other traders.</p>\n<p>In reality, when you purchase products to join a &ldquo;forex trading program,&rdquo; the person who recruited you into the program gets some kind of reward, as does the person who recruited them, and so on and so forth all the way up the pyramid.</p>\n<h3>3. A focus on recruiting instead of trading</h3>\n<p>When you get involved with a forex pyramid scheme, you might do some trading, but the amount of money you make from it will be small, if you make anything at all.</p>\n<p>Instead, other people in the scheme will push you to recruit new members in order to get paid, or perhaps receive access to even more exclusive training materials and trading information that will help you become an expert trader.</p>\n<p>In the end, you&rsquo;ll find yourself more worried about getting commissions from getting people to join the program and then encouraging them to recruit even more people than you are about making actual trades and earning real money from your efforts.</p>\n<p>So, whenever someone offers to &ldquo;teach you about forex&rdquo; or &ldquo;show you how to make a lot of money by trading,&rdquo; be very wary of their true motivations. If you spot any of these red flags, turn and walk away. You can still definitely make legitimate money on your own by forex trading!</p>\n<h2>Example of how a real forex pyramid scheme works, step by step:</h2>\n<h3>Step 1</h3>\n<p>Someone who starts a forex pyramid scheme typically reaches out to you, an unsuspecting victim, via social media and starts claiming they can teach you how to make large amounts of money fast by trading forex, so you can start &ldquo;living your best life.&rdquo;</p>\n<h3>Step 2</h3>\n<p>Once you agree to join their trading program, you are required to send them money in order for access to training courses and materials that will help you get started trading forex. You might make small investments, but you aren&rsquo;t making any significant amount of money.</p>\n<h3>Step 3</h3>\n<p>The person who recruited you starts offering you commissions and other incentives if you recruit more people into the program, so you do, and the people above you make even more money, while you&rsquo;re still not seeing any significant returns on your forex investments.</p>\n<h3>Step 4</h3>\n<p>You aren&rsquo;t making those huge amounts of money you were promised, so you pay for more products and services to help you become a &ldquo;better trader,&rdquo; and you continue to recruit more people into the program for the rewards it provides &mdash; you are now part of a forex pyramid scheme and the cycle continues, with you never becoming an expert at trading forex.</p>\n<p>Does this sound familiar?

There&rsquo;s no doubt that the platform is full of tons of real profiles of people who are there looking for love, but there are also Tinder scams that you should be on the lookout for.</p>\n<p>In this article, we&rsquo;ll go over some of the most common ways scammers use Tinder to trick people looking for love out of their money. We&rsquo;ll also give you some tips for how to avoid Tinder scams.</p>\n<h2>5 Most Common Tinder Scams</h2>\n<h3>1. Tinder bots</h3>\n<p>There are many automated Tinder profiles that will engage you in conversation and try to get you to provide personal information or click on links to third-party sites or downloads. They might do this by pretending they want you to download a game to play with them, but the link will really install malware on your device or ask you for your credit card information.</p>\n<h3>2. Tinder catfishing scam</h3>\n<p>Scammers create fake profiles on Tinder using pictures of real people they find elsewhere online to make the profiles appear more real. They then engage with users on the platform to scam them in various ways.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/26092b74dc2151e514d7a0cefc7bb207.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/26092b74dc2151e514d7a0cefc7bb207.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"390\"></picture></p>\n<p>For example, once the scammers have you hooked and thinking that you&rsquo;ve met someone you might have a real connection with, they could start asking you for money to help them out of a troubling financial situation they&rsquo;re in. Or, they might try to pry sensitive data out of you that they can use to steal from you.</p>\n<h3>3. Tinder blackmail scam</h3>\n<p>Scammers don&rsquo;t shy away from classic blackmail, and Tinder is the perfect platform for it. Once you&rsquo;ve been flirting back and forth with a fake Tinder match, they might start asking you to send nudes or other compromising photos.</p>\n<p>Then, once they have the photos in their possession, they reveal their true nature and start blackmailing you, threatening to post the photos online or send them to friends, family members, or coworkers if you don&rsquo;t pay up.</p>\n<h3>4. Tinder code scam</h3>\n<p>This Tinder scam doesn&rsquo;t involve any fake accounts on the platform itself, but is a type of phishing scam that works similarly to traditional email phishing scams.</p>\n<p>It starts with you receiving an email or a text claiming to be from Tinder and telling you that you need to verify your account to continue using the platform.</p>\n<p>The email or text tries to get you to click on a link that takes you to a third-party site, which then asks you to enter sensitive information that can be used to scam you and steal money from you.<br />\nThis type of Tinder scam is also known as a Tinder safe code scam,  a Tinder verification code scam, or a Tinder text scam.</p>\n<h3>5. Tinder venue promotion scam</h3>\n<p>Even promoters are using Tinder to scam people into coming to the venues they work for. They get you to agree to meet them in real life, then tell you to meet them at a specific venue that you have to pay to get into. Once you get in, of course, your date isn&rsquo;t there, and you&rsquo;re out all the money you just paid for the cover!</p>\n<h2>How To Avoid Tinder Scams</h2>\n<h3>Ask complicated questions</h3>\n<p>Tinder bots are good at answering short and easy &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; type questions. However, if you ask longer, more thoughtful questions, they won&rsquo;t be able to provide a good response. This is a good way to weed out bots if you ever have doubts about the authenticity of a profile.</p>\n<h3>Ask to talk on the phone</h3>\n<p>Scammers are usually unwilling to talk on the phone, because they are rarely who they say they are. If you ask a match to talk on the phone and they refuse, there&rsquo;s a good chance they are catfishing you and potentially trying to scam you.</p>\n<h3>Reverse search their profile image</h3>\n<p>You can reverse search a Tinder image by screenshotting it and uploading it into the search bar at  images.google.com. When you search with the image, you can see everywhere else it appears online. So, if someone is catfishing you, a profile with a different name and the same picture might appear.</p>\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t send them any money</h3>\n<p>No matter how real they might seem and how much you believe their story, never send any money to anyone you haven&rsquo;t met in person and have only talked to via Tinder. Even if you get blackmailed, don&rsquo;t send the scammers money &mdash; chances are they&rsquo;ll just keep asking you for more and more.</p>\n<h3>Check for typos on any code verifications</h3>\n<p>Typos are an easy way to spot texts and emails that are phishing. If you receive any type of communication that appears to be from Tinder, read it very carefully and watch out for typos and other errors, such as grammatical mistakes or weird phrasing. Many scammers speak a language other than English, so their fake messages are easy to spot.</p>\n<h3>Avoid meeting at specific venues that cost to enter</h3>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re going on a first date with someone you met on Tinder, always go somewhere public and free to get in. There are plenty of coffee shops, restaurants, and bars without covers, so there&rsquo;s no need to go to an expensive club on the first date. If the person you&rsquo;re talking to insists on you going to a place you have to pay to get into, cancel the date.</p>\n<h3>What To Do If You Are Scammed</h3>\n<p>If you follow the tips in this article and know what to look out for, you can avoid many common Tinder scams. However, many scammers are very good at what they do, and there are always new types of scams coming out that you might not be aware of.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve fallen victim to a Tinder scam, don&rsquo;t despair &mdash; Payback LTD can help.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Payback is one of the world&rsquo;s leading international <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/\">scam recovery specialist</a>.

In fact, most card issuers provide a 120-day window for chargebacks from the time you suspect you&rsquo;ve made a card payment to fraudsters.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/b187d5c74ddf5c9482f5cc919362c920.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/b187d5c74ddf5c9482f5cc919362c920.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"389\"></picture></p>\n<p>To start the process, write a letter to your card issuer explaining all the details of the scam, including the dates and sums of all the payments you want to charge back to your card. Provide any supporting evidence you have, such as emails from/to the scammers, URLs of scam websites, and anything else that can be used as evidence for your case.</p>\n<p>This should only take you a day or so to get together, and after that all you have to do is wait for your card company to approve the chargeback. Card issuers take an average of 30 days to review your case. This makes chargebacks one of the easiest and quickest ways to get money back from a scammer.</p>\n<h3>Bank refunds for bank transfers</h3>\n<p>Another common way scammers receive funds is through direct bank transfers. If you&rsquo;ve transferred money to scammers from your bank account, you might be wondering &ldquo;will my bank refund me if I get scammed?&rdquo; Well, as long as you notify your bank immediately, they may be able to reverse the transfer.</p>\n<p>When you realize you transferred funds from your account to a scammer&rsquo;s account, inform the bank about what happened and give them the number of the account you transferred to and the exact sum of the money you transferred.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Many banks have voluntarily signed agreements to take certain steps to protect and reimburse customers when they are the victims of <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/money-transfer-scams/\">bank transfer scams</a>, also known as authorized push payment scams.</p>\n<p>If your bank decided to refund you based on the evidence, you can have the funds back in your account in as little as 0-3 business days.</p>\n<h3>Hiring fund recovery specialists</h3>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re unsuccessful in getting money back through a chargeback or refund, or if you made a payment via another platform (like a cryptocurrency exchange or a fraudulent trading broker), there are still ways to recover your funds. The best way to do so is to contract a scam<a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/\"> fund recovery specialist</a> (like PayBack LTD) immediately.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Scam fund recovery experts are financial industry professionals and cybercrime specialists who know how to track down online scammers (nobody is truly anonymous online) and hit them in ways that pressure them to return your funds. These experts also have experience in recovering non-traditional funds, such as Bitcoin.</p>\n<h3>Reporting and flagging scams</h3>\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t really a way to get your money back after being scammed online, but it can help protect you and others from future scams. If you were scammed by an ad on social media, you can flag the fraudulent ad by clicking on the three dots in the top right-hand corner (on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram) and selecting the &ldquo;report&rdquo; option.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re unable to find the ad that led to you being scammed, you can also report it directly through the relevant platform&rsquo;s help center.</p>\n<p>For any type of scam, there are specific government agencies that receive reports. For example, in the US, you can report scams to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at: <a href=\"https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ReportFraud.ftc.gov</a>. In the UK, you can report phishing email scams to the National Cybersecurity Center via an email to <a href=\"mailto:report@phishing.gov.uk\">report@phishing.gov.uk</a>.</p>\n<p>These agencies are different in every country, but you can easily find out who to report scams to in your country with a quick Google search.</p>\n<p>No matter where you&rsquo;re located, you should report scams as soon as you realize you&rsquo;ve been targeted. Showing evidence that you&rsquo;ve reported a scam may also help you recover money from a scammer through a chargeback or bank transfer refund.</p>\n<h2 id=\"elementor-tab-title-8811\" data-tab=\"1\" role=\"tab\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\">What is the safest way to get your money back?</a></h2>\n<p>The safest (and quickest) way to get money back from a scammer is always directly through your financial institution. In other words, through a chargeback from your card issuer or a refund from your bank.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, these options don&rsquo;t work 100% of the time, in which case the safest way is to hire scam fund recovery experts who know what they&rsquo;re doing and have extensive experience with all types of scams.</p>\n<h2 id=\"elementor-tab-title-8812\" data-tab=\"2\" role=\"tab\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\">Can you always get your money back?</a></h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, no. If you make a cash payment, including through a wire transfer service like Western Union or MoneyGram, you&rsquo;re much less likely to get your money back. But, for other types of payments, you have very good chances of recovering funds from scammers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"elementor-tab-title-8813\" data-tab=\"3\" role=\"tab\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\">How long does the recovery process take?</a></h2>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re attempting to recover your funds through a chargeback, the case review process may take from 2-6 weeks, or in some cases longer. It can take months to actually see the money put back on your card.</p>\n<p>For bank transfer refunds, the recovery process length varies depending on the bank, but refunds are typically processed within 5 days max, and usually less than 3.</p>\n<p>When you contract the services of a scam funds recovery company, their team of professionals get on your case right away. The amount of time it takes to get your money back varies from case to case, but the specialists always aim to recover your funds as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>If you suspect you&rsquo;ve been the victim of an online scam, <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/contact-us/\">contact PayBack LTD today</a>. Our team will look at all the evidence and determine the fastest way to get your money back from scammers.</p>\n",

This is no less true for non-traditional currencies, such as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re thinking about investing in Bitcoin or are already doing so, it&rsquo;s important to understand how some <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/17-cryptocurrency-investment-scams-you-must-know-about/\">common Bitcoin scams</a> work. In the unfortunate event that you do get scammed out of your Bitcoin, don&rsquo;t despair just yet &mdash; there are some options you can try for getting Bitcoin back from a scammer.</p>\n<h2>Two options to get your Bitcoin back from a scammer:</h2>\n<h3>1. Contact the exchange platform you used</h3>\n<p>If you used a legitimate crypto exchange to send funds to a scammer, contact them the moment you suspect you&rsquo;ve been the victim of a scam and provide them with as much information as you can. If the funds are still sitting in the exchange, there is a chance that you can get them back.</p>\n<p>If you were scammed through a <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/blacklisted-brands/\">fraudulent crypto exchange or trading platform</a>, one thing you can try to get your money back from a Bitcoin scammer is to contact the fraudulent company directly. Let them know that you know they scammed you and that you are in the process of reporting them to the relevant authorities and will do everything in your power to get your funds back.</p>\n<p>This may be a long shot, but sometimes just the threat of legal action can be enough to get scammers to return your funds. However, if they have already transferred your Bitcoin to a private wallet and the fraudulent exchange platform is already offline, they are unlikely to respond to your requests.</p>\n<p>That being said, there are professionals who deal with this type of thing every day. See option two below for more information about hiring Bitcoin scam recovery experts if you are unsuccessful in your DIY attempts.</p>\n<h3>2. Hire scam recovery experts like PayBack LTD</h3>\n<p>Scam <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/\">fund recovery experts, such as PayBack LTD</a>, are comprised of financial industry veterans and cybercrime professionals who know exactly how to press scammers hard to get your money back.</p>\n<p>Nothing is truly anonymous on the internet, and our team of <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/binary-options-scams/\">Bitcoin scam recovery experts</a> will do everything in our power to track down the scammers and confront them to get your money back. We also have ways to hit scammers where it hurts the most: their financial funnels where they store stolen funds.</p>\n<p>The process of taking legal action against scammers yourself can be daunting and exhausting. Hiring scam fund recovery experts can take the pressure off you and is much more likely to result in the successful recovery of your defrauded funds.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s face it; government agencies are unlikely to pay much attention to your case unless you&rsquo;ve lost hundreds of thousands of dollars to a Bitcoin scam. There are simply too many small-time scammers out there and not enough resources to pursue them all.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s where a private agency like PayBack LTD comes in. We have<a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/testimonials/\"> recovered more than $210,000,000 in funds</a> from all types of financial scams, including cryptocurrency scams.</p>\n<p><strong>Tips to keep your Bitcoin safe:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Never pay strangers in Bitcoin</li>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t believe in too-good-to-be-true promises about huge ROIs</li>\n<li>Use reputable, secure crypto wallets to store funds</li>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t use unregulated crypto exchanges</li>\n<li>Watch out for Bitcoin pyramid schemes</li>\n<li>Keep an eye out for Bitcoin phishing emails and social media messages</li>\n<li>Never risk funds you can&rsquo;t afford to lose</li>\n<li>Always thoroughly investigate crypto wallets, platforms, and investment info</li>\n<li>Use antivirus software and malware protection on your devices</li>\n<li>Never share your passwords and logins</li>\n<li>Use a different email strictly for your Bitcoin communications and transactions</li>\n<li>Stay up to date on the most common Bitcoin Scams</li>\n</ul>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/806bb3fda21138bd52aeca136d8f38d7.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/806bb3fda21138bd52aeca136d8f38d7.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"389\"></picture></p>\n<h2>How do scammers steal your Bitcoin?</h2>\n<h3>Bitcoin phishing scams</h3>\n<p>One common way cryptocurrency scammers may try to steal your Bitcoin is by sending emails, texts, or social media messages requesting payments in Bitcoin. These messages often try to appear as if they are from reputable companies or even government organizations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This type of Bitcoin scam works in a similar fashion to traditional phishing scams and is fairly easy to avoid if you know what to look out for. The important thing to remember is that Bitcoin is not backed by any government or financial institution, so no legitimate organization will ever ask you for payments in Bitcoin for any reason.</p>\n<h3>Bitcoin pyramid schemes</h3>\n<p>Another common Bitcoin scam functions like a classic pyramid scheme. Scammers will try to recruit you into an investment program, then ask you to pay Bitcoin into the program for the right to recruit other investors into it. They incentivize you to do this by promising rewards in Bitcoin when you recruit others, but these payments never materialize.</p>\n<p>Always be wary of anyone offering you membership into some type of investment or business program which asks for payment of any kind in order to get started.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/identify-and-avoid-pyramid-schemes/\">Learn more about pyramid scams</a></p>\n<h3>Too-good-to-be-true investment offers</h3>\n<p>Bitcoin scammers often pose as investment managers or advisors and claim that they can help you rapidly grow your money if you let them handle your Bitcoin. They may ask you to transfer Bitcoin to them directly or provide you with the details of a fake &ldquo;investment account&rdquo; for you to deposit funds in.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once you transfer Bitcoin to a fraudulent investment manager, they usually disappear with the funds and become uncontactable. Or, you might find that when you try to make a withdrawal from the investment account, they provided you with, you either aren&rsquo;t able to, or you have to pay additional fees in order to make a withdrawal.</p>\n<h3>Crypto wallet hacks</h3>\n<p>Crypto scammers occasionally find ways to steal Bitcoin without even interacting with their targets. They do this by hacking crypto wallet platforms to steal massive amounts of Bitcoin from their users.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re investing in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, it&rsquo;s absolutely vital to use wallet platforms that have high levels of security and don&rsquo;t have a history of being hacked.</p>\n<h3>Bitcoin exchange scams</h3>\n<p>With the rapid rise in popularity of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general, there has naturally been a boom in crypto exchanges where you can buy and sell non-traditional currencies. However, not all of these exchanges are legitimate.</p>\n<p>Some exchanges come online with the end goal of stealing their users&rsquo; funds. They market themselves to attract investors; then, when there are enough people using the platform, they go offline along with all of the cryptocurrencies that have been deposited in them.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Like cryptocurrency, Bitcoin scams are a relatively new type of online scam that you have to be on the lookout for. Because it is thus far unregulated, it can be very difficult to get Bitcoin back from a scammer. Fortunately, there are experts out there who specialize in doing so and have a strong track record of recovering stolen Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies from scammers.</p>\n<p>If you know or suspect that you&rsquo;ve been scammed out of your prized Bitcoin, don&rsquo;t wait a second longer to <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/contact-us/\">contact PayBack LTD</a>.

Here are a few examples of the most common forex scams:</p>\n<h3>Price manipulation scams</h3>\n<p>In a forex price manipulation scam, illegitimate brokers manipulate the spreads they offer and other trading data to make it look like you&rsquo;re making less money than you are in order to pocket your funds for themselves.</p>\n<h3>Withdrawal fraud</h3>\n<p>This is another type of scam that fraudulent forex brokers use to walk away with your money. Instead of even bothering to manipulate data to trick you out of your money, they simply don&rsquo;t let you withdraw it when you want to. If you try to contact the scam brokers about withdrawing your funds, they may offer a confusing explanation or not even reply to your inquiries at all.</p>\n<h3>Pyramid schemes</h3>\n<p>Forex pyramid schemes, or <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/identify-and-avoid-pyramid-schemes/\">Ponzi and multi-level marketing schemes</a>, are something else to watch out for in the forex trading community. With these types of schemes, someone will try and recruit you into joining some type of investment program that you have to pay upfront to be a part of. They usually do this by promising access to special training and tools that will help you make big returns on your investments.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, once you&rsquo;re part of the program, the focus is typically more on getting you to recruit others into the program the same way you were recruited. You&rsquo;ll be offered small incentives for recruiting people, but most of the money coming in from new sign-ups gets funneled up the pyramid.</p>\n<h3>Scam bots</h3>\n<p>Some forex scammers employ <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/pros-cons-of-automated-trading-systems-all-you-need-to-know/\">forex trading bots</a> that are supposed to make automatic trades for you to consistently make you money. Though legitimate trading bots do exist, the ones scammers use are often untested and unsophisticated, meaning they are much more likely to lose you money than provide you with a good ROI. Any money you pay for using such a trading bot service goes to the scammers.</p>\n<h3>Fraudulent investment managers</h3>\n<p>Forex scammers often pose as legitimate investment advisors or managers in order to swindle inexperienced traders out of their funds. They allege to be vastly successful and offer to give you advice in exchange for a fee. They may even work in groups or employ others to write fake reviews of their services to trick unsuspecting investors into the scam.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Of course, the investment advice they give is usually useless, and the money you paid for it is long gone. If you try to claim a refund for the bad investment advice, the scammers just disappear or offer an unsatisfactory explanation for why your trades didn&rsquo;t work out.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/7b22a0b27060457b93d608798738c160.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/7b22a0b27060457b93d608798738c160.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"389\"></picture></p>\n<h2>Step 2: Recognizing scammers early</h2>\n<p>Besides knowing what the common forex scams are, there are some other red flags to watch out for to help you spot potential scammers early on. Here are a few examples:</p>\n<h3>&ldquo;Get rich quick&rdquo; promises.</h3>\n<p>A top tip for how to identify and avoid forex scams is to beware of any promises that sound too good to be true. The truth about investing is that it takes most people a lot of time and dedication to start making large amounts of money. So, anyone promising huge returns on your initial investments is very likely to be some type of scammer.</p>\n<h3>Unsolicited marketing</h3>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re receiving unsolicited communications about forex trading via email, text, or social media, be very wary of the individual or company sending them. Unless you specifically signed up to receive information from a forex broker, any marketing material you receive could be trying to hook you into falling for any one of the scams mentioned in the section above.</p>\n<p>These types of unsolicited communications, especially through social media, are often very pushy and bombard you with the types of &ldquo;get rich quick&rdquo; promises mentioned above. Remember that legit brokers or investment advisors shouldn&rsquo;t reach out to you through your DMs and shouldn&rsquo;t make any too-good-to-be-true promises.</p>\n<h3>Unregulated broker sites</h3>\n<p>Many forex scammers pass themselves off as legitimate brokers and have professional looking sites. However, if you do a little due diligence, you&rsquo;ll find out that they are unregulated, meaning that they don&rsquo;t have to answer to anyone for their actions if they make off with your money. <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/blacklisted-brands/\">If a forex broker is unregulated</a>, that is a HUGE red flag, which brings us to the next step&#8230;</p>\n<h2>Step 3: Only use regulated brokers</h2>\n<p>The best way to ensure you avoid forex trading scams is to always use <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/forex-regulations-101-who-controls-foreign-exchange-brokers/\">regulated broker platforms</a>. What this means is that the brokers are regulated by some type of government agency in the countries where they are based.</p>\n<p>For example, in the US, licensed brokers are regulated by the Commodities Futures Trade Commission (<a href=\"https://www.cftc.gov/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CFTC</a>) and the National Futures Association (<a href=\"https://www.nfa.futures.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NFA</a>). In the UK, legitimate brokers are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (<a href=\"https://www.fca.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">FCA</a>).</p>\n<p>In order to determine if a forex broker is regulated, read all the fine print on their website. There should be information at the bottom of the page and elsewhere on the site that states the specific government bodies that regulate the broker. You can then do some additional research to make sure the information is legit and that the regulating bodies have a good reputation.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve been scammed by an unregulated forex broker, <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/\">contact PayBack LTD today for help</a> recovering your lost funds. Our team is composed of forex trading veterans and cybercrime experts. We will do everything we can to get your money back.</p>\n<h2>Step 4: Only use reputable brokers</h2>\n<p>Besides checking to make sure any broker you use is regulated, it&rsquo;s also important to make sure that they are reputable and that investors have had real success using them. You can do this by reading reviews and opinions on trusted forex trading informational sites and forums.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Here are some examples of reputable forex brokers you can check out:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>CMC Markets</li>\n<li>London Capital Group</li>\n<li>Saxo Capital Markets</li>\n<li>XTB Online Trading</li>\n<li>IG Group</li>\n<li>Pepperstone</li>\n<li>TD Ameritrade</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>So, now you should have a much better understanding of how to avoid forex trading scams. To reiterate the steps above: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>make sure you know the common forex trading scams</li>\n<li>know how to recognize scammers early</li>\n<li>only use regulated forex brokers</li>\n<li>and only use reputable forex brokers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you follow these rules for investing in forex, you can make legitimate trades on the market to make money.</p>\n<p>Remember that if you do get scammed, there are ways to get your money back.

Thousands of people looking for new ways to invest their money are wondering the same thing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The short answer to that question is yes, forex trading is a legitimate way to make money by investing in foreign currencies on the foreign exchange market.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, as with any investment, you have to know what you&rsquo;re doing in order to actually make a return on your investment. This includes knowing what <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/blacklisted-brands/\">illegitimate forex trading platforms</a> and forex scams to look out for.</p>\n<p>In this article we&rsquo;ll go into more detail about what makes forex trading legit, as well as when forex trading is not legit. By the time you&rsquo;re done reading, you should have all the information you need to make the decision about whether or not you want to get into forex trading yourself.</p>\n<h2>Forex is legit because&hellip;</h2>\n<h3>Good second income</h3>\n<p>Since forex is based on trading currencies, it is fairly possible to make money off forex trades at any time &mdash; even during recessions. There are always going to be strong and weak currencies on the market, so there are always opportunities to buy and sell and make a good return on your investment.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/4ab57992d449d2f7b3995aec1a4091f4.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/4ab57992d449d2f7b3995aec1a4091f4.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"389\"></picture></p>\n<p>This makes forex a viable option for a second income, and something that you may even be able to fall back on if your other sources of income take a hit due to job loss or a recession.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>How much money you can make trading forex depends a lot on your dedication and your experience. Part-time forex traders often make enough that it&rsquo;s a significant supplemental income, while full-time traders can make the equivalent of a full-time wage or even more.</p>\n<h3>Requires little startup capital</h3>\n<p>Another reason why forex trading is so popular is that you can get into it with a very small sum of money. In fact, some traders start with as little as just $100! However, keep in mind that the less money you invest, the smaller your returns will be. You&rsquo;re not going to turn trading forex into your day job with just a few hundred dollars.</p>\n<p>So, how much money should you invest in forex to get started? Well, this is really totally up to you and what kind of risks you&rsquo;re willing to take. That being said, a general rule of thumb to follow is that you should never invest more than 1% of the money you have in your bank account in forex.</p>\n<h3>Regulatory agencies</h3>\n<p>A big part of the reason why forex is legit is that the forex market is fully regulated by various global regulatory agencies. For example, in the United States, forex is regulated by the Commodities Futures Trade Commission (<a href=\"https://www.cftc.gov/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CFTC</a>) and the National Futures Association (<a href=\"https://www.nfa.futures.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">NFA</a>).</p>\n<p>Likewise, legitimate <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/forex-regulations-101-who-controls-foreign-exchange-brokers/\">forex brokers are also regulated and licensed</a> by various agencies in their home countries. BUT, and it&rsquo;s a big but, there are unregulated brokers out there that you have to watch out for. More on that later&#8230;</p>\n<h3>Well-known platforms</h3>\n<p>There are so many forex trading platforms and brokers out there that it can be overwhelming trying to choose one. The good news is that there are several very well-known forex platforms that you can narrow your choices down to when getting started.</p>\n<p><strong>Here are a few examples:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>CMC Markets</li>\n<li>London Capital Group</li>\n<li>Saxo Capital Markets</li>\n<li>XTB Online Trading</li>\n<li>IG Group</li>\n<li>Pepperstone</li>\n<li>TD Ameritrade</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Forex is not legit because&hellip;</h2>\n<h3>Forex scams</h3>\n<p>One of the biggest reasons why people are always asking &ldquo;is forex trading legit?&rdquo; is that there are so many forex trading scams out there. There are many different types of forex scams, ranging from fake investment advice to broker scams and pyramid schemes. We&rsquo;ll touch on how some of them work below.</p>\n<h3>Unregulated brokers exist</h3>\n<p>Because of the fact that there are so many forex brokers out there that they can blend in with, scammers often pose as legit brokers and make off with investors&rsquo; money. This type of scam is known as a forex broker scam and is the reason why it&rsquo;s so important to always choose a regulated and licensed forex broker to do your trading with.</p>\n<p>The majority of forex scammers operate as unregulated brokers, meaning that there are no government agencies or financial institutions holding them accountable for their actions. Because of this, these unregulated scam brokers are able to set up sites and platforms that look legit to attract new investors. Once they get ahold of your funds, they can manipulate charts and other data to make it look like you lost money, when in fact they are stealing it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Or, these scam brokers can simply refuse to release your funds when you try to make a withdrawal, even going so far as to shut down the site and disappear into thin air.</p>\n<h3>Pyramid schemes</h3>\n<p>Another common type of forex trading scam that makes people wonder whether forex is legit is that it could function like a pyramid scheme. In <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/is-forex-a-pyramid-scheme-what-to-look-for/\">a forex pyramid scheme</a>, the masterminds recruit eager, inexperienced investors to join their &ldquo;investment program,&rdquo; with promises that they&rsquo;ll make huge returns on their forex investments.</p>\n<p>The catch is that to join the program, you first have to pay a fee. Then, the scammers offer you incentives for recruiting others into the program, ultimately growing the number of people paying into their pockets. The reality is that these programs usually focus very little on investing, and place much more emphasis on recruiting more investors.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/78a723b870b067f1ffee6337f04b50f1.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/78a723b870b067f1ffee6337f04b50f1.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"427\"></picture></p>\n<p>These pyramid schemes, or multi-level marketing schemes, usually continue to try and get you to pay for products or lessons that are supposed to make you better at trading. Even though you might be making small sums of money, you&rsquo;re typically putting way more back into the scammers&rsquo; bank accounts.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Can lose money</h3>\n<p>As you can see from the examples above, forex scammers are one of the biggest risks to new traders. Because forex investors are often young and lack trading experience in general, they&rsquo;re much more likely to lose money on forex by falling victim to a broker scam or a pyramid scheme.</p>\n<p>However, even experienced and skilled traders can lose money trading forex. This is just the reality of investing&nbsp; &mdash; there&rsquo;s always the possibility of losing big. That&rsquo;s why you should never risk more than you can afford to use.</p>\n<p>So, what if you lose money on a legit forex trade? Well, the only thing you can do is cut your losses, learn from it, and move on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But, what if you lose money because of a forex scam? Can you <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/forex-scams/\">get money back from forex scammers</a>? YES!

There are tons of fake accounts on TikTok that will try to lure you into providing payments or sensitive information.</p>\n<p>In this article, we&rsquo;ll explain what some of the most common TikTok scams are in 2022, as well as provide you with some tips for how to protect yourself.</p>\n<h2>The Growth of TikTok</h2>\n<p>Before we dive into the different types of TikTok scams out there, let&rsquo;s take a quick look at what exactly the app is and how it got so big over the last year or so for some context.</p>\n<p>TikTok is a short-form video-sharing app that launched internationally in September of 2017. It originally allowed users to create 15-second videos synced to in-app music. In its earliest days, TikTok was mainly full of users lip-syncing, dancing, or acting out short sketches.</p>\n<p>TikTok has since increased the max video length to 3 minutes and is now full of content about everything under the sun, from financial advice to recipe videos. The app now reportedly has more than 1.2 billion daily active users &mdash; a lot of potential targets for scammers!</p>\n<h2>6 Most Common TikTok Scams</h2>\n<h4>1. Adult Content TikTok Scam</h4>\n<p>In this TikTok scam, fraudulent accounts steal images or videos of women in bikinis or workout clothes and upload them to TikTok to entice users looking for adult content. The scam accounts then redirect followers to Snapchat or adult content sites, eventually prompting them to provide credit card details or other information to pay for &ldquo;premium&rdquo; content.</p>\n<h4>2. TikTok Scam Apps</h4>\n<p>Fake accounts on TikTok sometimes promote fraudulent apps that they want you to download. The accounts either make misleading claims about apps that users have to pay for, or the apps themselves will actually install adware or malware on your device to spam you with ads or steal your info.</p>\n<h4>3. Fake Celebrities</h4>\n<p>Another thing you should watch out for on TikTok is accounts impersonating real-life celebrities. Many scammers are great at essentially replicating a real celebrity&rsquo;s account by stealing their existing content to entice unsuspecting TikTok users into following them. They may then use the fake accounts to promote other fraudulent content, such as crypto investing scams.</p>\n<h4>4. More Likes and Followers</h4>\n<p>This TikTok scam targets people looking to grow their fanbase and become influential TikTokers themselves. The scam accounts offer users likes and followers in exchange for payment, downloading an app, or taking some other kind of action. Once you do what the scam account wants you to, you either won&rsquo;t get any followers or likes at all, or they will all be from fake accounts and bots with obviously false names and pictures.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/2815fddaf29fe7541f0cc7c4f9e529dd.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/2815fddaf29fe7541f0cc7c4f9e529dd.jpg\" width=\"342\" height=\"512\"></picture></p>\n<h4>5. TikTok Scam Email Phishing</h4>\n<p>A TikTok scam email is basically a regularr <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/5-easy-ways-to-spot-a-phishing-email-with-examples/\">phishing email</a> that goes out to anyone with a TikTok account whose email address scammers have managed to get ahold of. They might try to offer you sponsorship, a bigger following, a verified badge, or some other special deal. If you click on any links in the email, you&rsquo;ll be redirected to a site that asks you for your login credentials or other personal information.</p>\n<h4>6. Bot Accounts</h4>\n<p>TikTok is also full of bot accounts that interact with users and try to trick you into thinking that you&#8217;re chatting with a real person. They might ask you directly for sensitive information or try to redirect you to scam sites that phish for your info or install malware on your device.</p>\n<h2>Who Are the Victims of TikTok Scams?</h2>\n<p>TikTok scams particularly look to target children and teens, because they are typically not as aware of the prevalence and dangers of online scams. People between the age of 10 and 19 also account for more than 30% of TikTok&rsquo;s user base.</p>\n<p>That being said, anyone can fall victim to a TikTok scam. Different scams target different types of users, so it&rsquo;s important to know what to be on the lookout for to stay safe on the platform.</p>\n<h2>Staying Safe on TikTok</h2>\n<p>Now that you know what 6 of the most common TikTok scams are, you might be wondering how you can protect yourself from TikTok scammers. Below, we&rsquo;ll give you some tips for how to spot fake accounts on TikTok and avoid becoming a victim of the most common scams</p>\n<h4>View Adult Content At Your Own Risk</h4>\n<p>The nature of adult content means that it can be very hard to know if you&rsquo;re going to get what you&rsquo;re paying for. Just be aware that TikTok is full of fake adult content accounts and be very wary of any accounts that try to redirect you to a Snapchat or a <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/12-easy-ways-to-check-if-a-website-is-legit-or-a-scam/\">website</a> that asks you for payment details right away.</p>\n<h4>Be Wary of Promoted Apps</h4>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t just blindly download any apps that you see promoted on TikTok. Make sure to do some research and read reviews before you download them to make sure that you&rsquo;re getting what you pay for and that you aren&rsquo;t going to be downloading adware or malware onto your device.</p>\n<h4>Double-Check the Authenticity of Celebrity Accounts</h4>\n<p>The easiest way to spot a real celebrity account is to look for a verified badge. Any legitimate celebrity will have this badge. However, it&rsquo;s not unheard of for scammers to figure out how to get the verified badge, so always do some investigating to make sure any celebrity accounts you follow are real. You can always just Google the celebrity&rsquo;s name and &ldquo;TikTok&rdquo; to find their legit handle.</p>\n<h4>Don&rsquo;t Take Shortcuts to More Likes and Followers</h4>\n<p>If you see any accounts promoting too-good-to-be-true ways to gain likes and followers fast, just avoid them. If you want to grow on TikTok, focus on creating quality content and gaining fans the organic way. Don&rsquo;t be tempted to pay for fans because they&rsquo;ll just end up being fake accounts or bots anyways.</p>\n<h4>Ignore Emails With Links About Your TikTok</h4>\n<p>Unless you get an official email from TikTok, never click on any links in emails offering you sponsorship or some other deal related to your account. No legitimate company should be emailing you links to click on related to your TikTok. They&rsquo;ll just take you to <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/6-common-phishing-scams-you-need-to-know-in-2021/\">phishing sites</a> or sites loaded with malware.</p>\n<h4>Watch Out for Bots</h4>\n<p>If anyone messages you on TikTok, be on the lookout for strange phrases and requests. If the conversation doesn&rsquo;t seem natural, or if the account has an unusual username, it&rsquo;s probably a bot. Never give any personal information out to anyone over TikTok.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Have You Been Scammed on TikTok or Elsewhere Online?</h2>\n<p>We work hard to track down fraudulent companies and scammers to take action against them and shut them down.

            "content": "<p>TikTok has banned its users from promoting and advertising any kind of financial services on the platform. This includes loans, credit cards, cryptocurrency, trading platforms, share trading, and &ldquo;buy now, pay later&rdquo; offers, among other things. The ban also aims to crack down on <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/identify-and-avoid-pyramid-schemes/\">pyramid schemes</a> and &ldquo;get rich quick&rdquo; schemes.</p>\n<p>TikTok has officially updated its branded content policy to prevent influencers from promoting financial services through partnerships with brands. The move to ban <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/17-cryptocurrency-investment-scams-you-must-know-about/\">crypto promotions</a> comes after a drastic rise in high-risk investments and financial frauds being promoted by social media influencers, especially on TikTok.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/2127f88e77d06a1e9698ab20cf870221.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/2127f88e77d06a1e9698ab20cf870221.jpg\" width=\"343\" height=\"512\"></picture></p>\n<p>The ban will not affect TikTok&rsquo;s advertising policy, which still allows legitimate financial services companies to advertise to anyone over the age of 18. Note that ads promoting cryptocurrencies and other virtual currencies are already banned.</p>\n<p>The idea is to prevent influencers from misleading younger investors, who are more prone to following unfounded investment advice from &ldquo;FinTok&rdquo; accounts, which could get them into serious financial trouble. This is especially true when it comes to volatile cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<p>TikTok is not the online company cracking down on crypto promotion as of late. Google also recently announced plans to ban savings and investments scam advertisements in the UK.</p>\n<p>Starting the 30th of August, 2021, any company that wishes to advertise financial services on Google will have to prove that they are authorized by the <a href=\"https://www.fca.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Financial Conduct Authority</a> (FCA), or qualify for a special limited exemption.</p>\n<p>Warnings about fraudulent financial advertisements on Google and social media platforms like TikTok doubled in 2020 from the previous year. <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/crypto-scams-increase-1000-in-less-than-a-year/\">Crypto scams alone increased 1000%</a> in less than a year, a trend that is sure to continue if companies don&rsquo;t clamp down on fraudulent promotions.</p>\n<h2>Why Are Crypto Influencers Risky?</h2>\n<p>Crypto influencers receive payments and other benefits from risky cryptocurrencies and crypto trading platforms in exchange for promoting their brands via their TikTok accounts and other social media accounts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is extremely risky because they are purely incentivized by making money, without thinking about the potential risks of the investment and financial advice they are giving to others. Crypto influencers often have little to no actual knowledge of what they are promoting. In some cases, they are even scammers themselves.</p>\n<p>Many crypto scams or<a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/how-to-protect-yourself-from-online-scams-top-tips/\"> fraudulent investment schemes</a> start with influencers promising something that&rsquo;s too good to be true. Users need to be wary of any type of investment advice that promises huge returns in a short amount of time.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/094d8b0b468e12100c3cf3c1c43771c1.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/094d8b0b468e12100c3cf3c1c43771c1.jpg\" width=\"512\" height=\"341\"></picture></p>\n<p>Inexperienced, usually younger, investors who rely on social media and crypto influencers for their financial advice are more prone to making high-risk investments or falling victim to <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/cryptocurrency-scams/\">crypto scams</a> that they are exposed to through platforms like TikTok. These financially vulnerable users are who the new TikTok ban aims to protect.</p>\n<p>With the recent explosion in the popularity of volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and others, even celebrities have become crypto promoters. This is even more dangerous because of their vast reach and the trust that fans and followers place in them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Crypto experts have noted that the only reason any celebrity is likely to be promoting crypto via their social media is because they have received free coins or another financial benefit from the crypto company for doing so. Celebrities are not authoritative sources of crypto information.</p>\n<p>The recent ban by TikTok puts cryptocurrencies alongside other products influencers are not allowed to promote, including alcohol, tobacco, and pharmaceuticals, to name a few.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Despite the change in policy, hashtags like #fintok and #stocktok are still racking up the views on TikTok, so users need to know how to protect themselves from bad investment advice and crypto scams on the platform.</p>\n<p>The easiest way to protect yourself is to simply not follow any financial advice or invest in crypto-based on something you see on TikTok.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, if you do want to keep using TikTok as a source of crypto and investment information, just be on the lookout for anything that sounds too good to be true.</p>\n<p>For example, don&rsquo;t follow the advice of any TikTok influencer claiming that they have the secret recipe to make you a millionaire fast.</p>\n<p>Always try to verify any information you hear on TikTok through reputable investment news sources or by talking to people you know who are more knowledgeable than you when it comes to investing.</p>\n<h2>Have You Fallen Victim To a TikTok Crypto Scam or Investment Scam?</h2>\n<p>Payback LTD&rsquo;s goal is to help anyone who has fallen victim to online fraud, including TikTok crypto influencer and &ldquo;fintok&rdquo; investment scams.

            "content": "<p>What do you get when you put Steven Seagal, a private eye, and an Australian-Serbian scammer together? A fraud resulting in a combined loss of more than $11 million dollars for nearly 500 investors.</p>\n<p>This is just one of many similar <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/17-cryptocurrency-investment-scams-you-must-know-about/\">crypto-mining scams</a> that have tricked investors out of tens of millions of dollars over the last year or so, but it&rsquo;s one that&rsquo;s grabbed a lot of attention because of the larger-than-life cast of characters involved.</p>\n<h2>How Did the Crypto Scam Work?</h2>\n<p>The scam starts with a company called &ldquo;Start Options,&rdquo; one of many similar online investment platforms springing up with the rise of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The platform offered crypto mining and trading services and claimed that it owned huge crypto-mining farms in China.</p>\n<p>The fake company advertised that it was looking for investors and that it could give them huge returns on their investments &mdash; anywhere from 25% to 200% within two months. Once investors fell for this too-good-to-be-true promise, they received false reports showing how their investments were rapidly growing.</p>\n<p>However, the reality was that their money wasn&rsquo;t really invested in anything. It was actually being funneled to offshore accounts controlled by the scammers.</p>\n<p>When the duped investors eventually started trying to withdraw their funds, they were informed that they were being rolled over into the initial offering of a new, unregistered cryptocurrency called Bitcoiin2Gen (B2G), and that they would receive even higher returns on their investments.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>No investors were ever given any of their money back and the scammers eventually disappeared with millions.</p>\n<h2>Who Was Responsible?</h2>\n<p>The mastermind behind the crypto scam was Kristijan Krstic, an Australian-Serbian scammer with a history of fraud. For the purposes of this particular scam, he assumed the false identity of Felix Logan, the &ldquo;Chief Financial Officer&rdquo; of Start Options.</p>\n<p>The current whereabouts of Krstic are not known, but the SEC has said it believes he is in custody in Serbia.</p>\n<p>The frontman for the scam was John DeMarr, a 55-year-old, California-based private investigator. He was enlisted to promote the company Start Options at the beginning of the crypto scam.</p>\n<p>John DeMarr claimed he was unaware that the company was a fraud when he was enlisted to promote it and did not know Krstic&rsquo;s true identity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, DeMarr pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. He is awaiting sentencing in January 2022 and could face up to five years in prison.</p>\n<h2>What Role Did Steven Seagal Play?</h2>\n<p>By now you&rsquo;re probably wondering: how did action movie star Steven Seagal get wrapped up in all this?</p>\n<p>Well, he was contracted by B2G to be a brand ambassador for the company, with a promise of $250,000 and $750,000 in B2G coin being made.</p>\n<p>Seagal promoted the fraudulent company to his more than 7 million combined followers on Facebook and Twitter, urging them not to miss out on the opportunity to invest in the new B2G coin.</p>\n<p>When Krstic disappeared with more than $7 million in the offshore accounts he had funneled investors&rsquo; money into, Seagal&rsquo;s manager claimed that he had been scammed just like everyone else and that he had only been paid a portion of the $250,000 he had been promised.</p>\n<p>The SEC alleged that Seagal had failed to disclose the sum of payments he received, allegations which he neither confirmed nor denied. The actor went on to settle with the SEC in February 2020, agreeing to pay more than $300,000 in fines.</p>\n<p>To conclude this strange saga, frontman DeMarr faked his own kidnapping to try and get angry investors off his back. He claimed he had gone to Montenegro to sell their B2G coins and that they would all get their money back, but the &ldquo;company&rdquo; then issued a statement that he had been assaulted and disappeared in Montenegro.</p>\n<h2>Can You Recover Money From a Crypto Scam?</h2>\n<p>Though crypto scams have increased <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/crypto-scams-increase-1000-in-less-than-a-year/\">more than 1000% over the last year</a>, there is still hope for those who have been scammed. If you <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/cryptocurrency-scams/\">fall victim to a crypto scam</a> or another type of online investment scam, there are ways to get your funds back.</p>\n<p>One of the easiest ways to try and get your money back is <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/a-guide-to-chargebacks-recover-your-funds-after-a-scam/\">through a chargeback</a>. This involves contacting your bank or your credit card issuer to explain your situation and request that they reverse any payments you&rsquo;ve made to fraudulent companies.</p>\n<p>You typically have to write a formal letter explaining how you were scammed and include the dates and sums of any charges you want to be reversed. You should also include any evidence you have of the scam, such as emails where you requested your funds back and were denied.</p>\n<p>If a chargeback doesn&rsquo;t work, another way you can often successfully get reimbursed is by hiring a <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/\">fund recovery specialist company</a>, such as Payback LTD.</p>\n<p>At Payback LTD, we have a team of financial and cybercrime experts who specialize in recovering money from cryptocurrency scams and other types of investment scams.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We are experienced in dealing with all kinds of crypto frauds and have a great track record of <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/testimonials/\">retrieving our clients&rsquo; funds.</a></p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve been the victim of a cryptocurrency scam, don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact us and discuss your case.

Unfortunately, the more prevalent new technologies become, the more ways scammers find to use them to their advantage.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re here to fill you in on what exactly a QR code scam is and how you can stay safe from them.</p>\n<h2>What Is a QR Code?</h2>\n<p>The term QR code is short for &ldquo;quick response code.&rdquo; These are basically a square-shaped, black-and-white digital code, similar to the rectangular barcodes that you see on packaging for consumer goods.</p>\n<p>You can scan a QR code right from your smartphone&rsquo;s camera and a link will pop up to wherever that QR code&rsquo;s creators want it to take you. It&rsquo;s an easy way for organizations and businesses to provide customers with quick information.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/dfc1fb90c51eb135f64e9c89b514e9d9.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/dfc1fb90c51eb135f64e9c89b514e9d9.jpg\" width=\"512\" height=\"342\"></picture></p>\n<p>For example, restaurants often place QR codes right on their tables that allow you to quickly pull up a digital menu on your phone. Or, a QR code on an advertisement for a new app might take you right to where you can download the app. But that&rsquo;s not all QR codes can do&#8230;</p>\n<h2>Can You Get Scammed With a QR Code?</h2>\n<p>While most QR codes are innocent and serve a legitimate purpose, there are also fraudulent QR codes out there that you need to be on the lookout for. A QR code scam can work in a variety of ways, but in general, they all try to get people to scan a QR code without thinking too much about where it came from.</p>\n<h3>How Do QR Code Scams Work?</h3>\n<p>Scammers send their fraudulent QR codes to their targets in different ways, such as by email, text message, or even a physical letter or flyer. They try to make the QR code look like it comes from a legitimate source so you&rsquo;ll scan it to see what it&rsquo;s all about.</p>\n<p>However, once you scan a fraudulent QR code, it often takes you to a <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/6-common-phishing-scams-you-need-to-know-in-2021/\">phishing site</a>, a payment app, or a malicious social media account or website. The scammers then try to get sensitive information or direct payments from you.</p>\n<p>For example, you might receive a QR code in an email that appears to be from a big company like Amazon. Then, when you scan it, it could take you to <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/12-easy-ways-to-check-if-a-website-is-legit-or-a-scam/\">a malicious website</a> that asks you to enter the username and password for your <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/is-online-shopping-safe-tips-to-avoid-scam-online-stores/\">personal Amazon account</a>.</p>\n<h3>How Do Scammers Get Your Information?</h3>\n<p>If a QR scam takes you to a phishing site, the rest of the scam plays out much like traditional phishing attacks. The site then prompts you to enter personal information, like your credit card number or bank account info, which the scammers then use to steal money from you. Or, it might try to get your login information for certain sites, so the scammers can hack your accounts.</p>\n<p>QR code scams may also function like <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/17-cryptocurrency-investment-scams-you-must-know-about/\">cryptocurrency and investment scams</a>, taking you to <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/cash-app-fraud-threat-what-you-can-do/\">payment apps</a> or fake investment social media accounts. The scammers then prompt you to send them payments in Bitcoin or another currency, promising you a too-good-to-be-true return on your investment.</p>\n<h3>How To Avoid QR Scams</h3>\n<p>A lot of the ways you can stay safe from QR code scams are similar to the ways you can protect yourself from <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/5-easy-ways-to-spot-a-phishing-email-with-examples/\">email phishing scams</a> and other common online scams. Here are some of the top tips from the experts for avoiding QR code scams:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> Verify the source of the QR code</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Whether you receive a QR code via email or text from a friend, or you get a QR code that appears to be from a company or a government agency, always double-check before you scan it.</p>\n<p>Scammers often hack someone&rsquo;s email or phone contacts to send out fraudulent QR codes to everyone they know. If someone you know sends a QR code to you, respond to them and ask whether they really sent it to make sure they weren&rsquo;t hacked.</p>\n<p>If the QR code came from an organization, check their official website or call their customer service to ask about it first. If you can&rsquo;t verify any reason why the company would send you the QR code, don&rsquo;t scan it.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong> Never scan QR codes from strangers</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you receive a QR code from someone you don&rsquo;t know, an email you don&rsquo;t recognize, or a company you&rsquo;ve never heard of, just don&rsquo;t scan it. If you get an email with a QR code that looks legit, but comes from a strange email address, don&rsquo;t scan it!</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong> Never provide passwords or other sensitive information</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>If a QR code pulls up a screen that prompts you to provide login information, banking information, or any other type of sensitive data, don&rsquo;t continue. No legit organization should ever request this kind of information via QR code.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong> Keep an eye out for legitimate advertising that has been tampered with</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>QR code scammers sometimes alter legit flyers, ads, or business cards by sticking a fraudulent QR code sticker on them. If you see QR codes that aren&rsquo;t actually printed on advertising materials, don&rsquo;t scan them.</p>\n<p>Scammers have even been known to slap malicious QR codes on walls or post boards with other advertisements, hoping that curious people passing by will scan them.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/0e732205618c29b3a94643fe5cfe06eb.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/0e732205618c29b3a94643fe5cfe06eb.jpg\" width=\"512\" height=\"400\"></picture></p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong> Be cautious about shortened links</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Shortened links are often used by scammers to hide malicious links. If a QR code appears to be from a legit company, but the link it pulls up is shortened and doesn&rsquo;t show you that it&rsquo;s taking you to their official website, it&rsquo;s probably best not to click on the link.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong> Use a more secure QR code scanner app</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Your phone probably has a built-in QR code scanner, but these aren&rsquo;t always the most secure. Download a third-party QR code scanner from an antivirus company or another reputable source for added security. These can often identify fraudulent links right away to keep you safe.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Phishing Scams MIN\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/f3Mv4C9ztMg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n",

Keep reading to find out what <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/protect-yourself-from-common-online-scams/\">phishing scams are most common</a> in 2021, so you can be on the lookout and avoid falling victim to a phishing attack.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/56c47780659411490ef965ea7fa36a25.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/56c47780659411490ef965ea7fa36a25.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"390\"></picture></p>\n<h2>What is a phishing scam?</h2>\n<p><b>Phishing scam definition:&nbsp;</b></p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;The practice of using fraudulent e-mails and copies of legitimate websites to extract financial data from computer users for purposes of identity theft.&rdquo;</i> &#8211; <a href=\"https://www.dictionary.com/browse/phishing#\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dictionary.com</a></p>\n<h3>What are phishing scams trying to do?</h3>\n<p>Though their techniques can vary, all phishing scams have one thing in common: they&rsquo;re trying to trick you into giving up or letting them steal sensitive information, such as account logins/passwords, bank account/credit card numbers, PINs, social security numbers, etc.</p>\n<p>They often do this by soliciting information from you via email or on fake sites, or by getting you to click on a link or download an attachment that installs malware onto your device to log your personal data.</p>\n<p>Phishing scams can target anyone who has an email, but scammers particularly like to target employees of medium- to large-sized businesses and organizations.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/fdafc3f0f08b54eec3b71a4fa08f85bc.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/fdafc3f0f08b54eec3b71a4fa08f85bc.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"467\"></picture></p>\n<h2>6 Common Phishing Scams in 2022 + Examples</h2>\n<h3>1. Spear Phishing</h3>\n<p>Spear phishing is a highly targeted form of phishing attack in which a scammer uses data they have already collected about you, your employer, or someone you know to create a sense of urgency.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Standard <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/5-easy-ways-to-spot-a-phishing-email-with-examples/\">email phishing scams</a> may send out hundreds or thousands of generic emails (like casting a fishing net) to try and get someone to bite and fall for the scam. In comparison, spear phishing attacks choose specific victims to target.</p>\n<p>This allows scammers to personalize emails, which can trick you into letting your guard down because you might think you know the sender or have some connection to them.</p>\n<p><strong>Spear Phishing Example:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>One spear phishing campaign was targeted at Sony employees, whose names and titles scammers looked up on LinkedIn.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once the scammers had this information, they sent personalized emails to the employees that appeared to come from Apple and requested them to verify their Apple ID credentials.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is just one example of an Apple phishing scam, as phishers often try to make emails appear to be from big, reputable companies.</p>\n<h3>2.Whaling</h3>\n<p>Whaling is similar to spear phishing, but it is even more targeted. Instead of going after many employees of the same company, scammers will try to target senior members, or &ldquo;big fish,&rdquo; of a company to steal their data.</p>\n<p>Whaling attempts usually try to create a fake sense of urgency to get an executive to click a link or download something that installs malware on the company&rsquo;s network. This malware then works in various ways to steal money from the company.</p>\n<p><strong>Whaling Example:</strong></p>\n<p>In 2015 a top finance executive at Mattel, the global toy giant, received an email regarding the transfer of $3 million to a bank in China.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The email allegedly already had the signature of Mattel&rsquo;s CEO on it and the finance executive never suspected a thing. They approved the transfer only to find out that it was a scam after discussing it with the CEO.</p>\n<h3>3.Vishing</h3>\n<p>Vishing is short for &ldquo;voice phishing.&rdquo; These phishing scams use voice phone calls or voicemails to trick their victims into giving up sensitive information.</p>\n<p>The scammers often pretend to be from a large organization, such as your bank or a government office and try to get you to provide them with information like your credit card number or social security number.</p>\n<p><strong>Vishing Example:</strong></p>\n<p>There was an Amazon phishing scam that employed the vishing technique. The scammers started by sending an email notifying the recipient that an order for something expensive had been placed through their Amazon account and asking them to confirm it by calling a number.</p>\n<p>Naturally, there was no order, so many panicked recipients called the number to find out what was going on, which is where the vishing came in.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whenever a target called the fake number, someone on the other end of the line pretended to be from Amazon&rsquo;s customer service team and asked them for information including their name and credit card number to supposedly look up the order.</p>\n<h3>4.CEO Fraud</h3>\n<p>CEO fraud is similar to whaling, but the scammers pretend to actually <i>be</i> the CEO or another high-ranking member of their victim&rsquo;s company.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They then try to trick their target into transferring company funds, updating payroll information, or installing a new app (i.e. malware) on their company computer.</p>\n<p><strong>CEO Fraud Example:</strong></p>\n<p>In 2016 an upper-level employee at Snapchat received an email that they thought was from the CEO. The scammers were eventually able to dupe the employee into providing sensitive payroll information.</p>\n<h3>5.Clone Phishing</h3>\n<p>Clone email phishing scams are a type of email phishing scam that copy, or clones, real emails from reputable companies.</p>\n<p>The scammers then replace or add links and attachments with malicious ones that are meant to install spyware on your device before resending the email.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They usually preface the email by saying there was a problem with the links or attachments in the original email to try and get you to click on or download them.</p>\n<p><strong>Clone Phishing Example:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>There have been other Amazon phishing scams that employed the clone phishing technique. These emails look just like legit Amazon emails informing users that they have earned some kind of reward or discount on their Prime account, but they include malicious links.</p>\n<h3>6.Search Engine Phishing</h3>\n<p>Search engine phishing is when scammers create websites that appear legitimate and get them to appear organically in search results on major search engines, like Google.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In some cases, these web pages may even attempt to look like they are part of a popular shopping site, such as eBay.</p>\n<p>These sites often feature enticing shopping deals or other offers that prompt you to create an account and enter your personal information when you click on them.</p>\n<p><strong>Search Engine Phishing Example:</strong></p>\n<p>Say you&rsquo;re browsing Google looking for deals on art supplies, and you see a link offering a great price for paint brushes. The link takes you to what looks like an Amazon login page, and you think &ldquo;oh, great, I have an Amazon account!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You then enter your username and password, only to find that it doesn&rsquo;t actually take you to your Amazon account. This is just one example of how search engine phishing scams can work.</p>\n<h3>How to prevent phishing scams:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Always <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/12-easy-ways-to-check-if-a-website-is-legit-or-a-scam/\">double-check the URL</a>s of sites</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Make sure the domains emails are sent from are legit</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Protect your computer with anti-malware software</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Update your mobile devices regularly</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Protect accounts with multi-factor authentication</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Backup your data in the cloud or on an external hard drive</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Learn how to<a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/5-easy-ways-to-spot-a-phishing-email-with-examples/\"> spot phishing emails</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

One common way scammers &ldquo;phish&rdquo; for sensitive information is by sending fake emails.</p>\n<p>In this article, we&rsquo;ll go over some of the most common ways scammers try to trick you into giving up your personal data via phishing emails. We&rsquo;ll also provide you with examples so you know what to be on the lookout for in your inbox.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/c621aabb3c276739eecea0cf4dd4e1b8.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/c621aabb3c276739eecea0cf4dd4e1b8.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"473\"></picture></p>\n<h2>What is a phishing email ?</h2>\n<p>Phishing emails are a technique used by online scammers to trick you into giving them personal information or account data (such as logins/passwords, bank account/credit card numbers, social security numbers).</p>\n<p>Once scammers have this sensitive information, they can use it to hack your accounts and steal money from you. There are thousands of these types of phishing attacks every day, so it&rsquo;s important that you know how to recognize them and protect yourself from scams.</p>\n<p>Tricksters have developed many different techniques to steal data from internet users over the years. Some phishing emails are immediately obvious, while others are harder to spot.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For example, phishing emails might try to trick you into clicking a link or opening an attachment with malware in it, which then infects your system to steal your data.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Or, the fraudulent emails might appear to be from a company you have an account with and ask you to provide your login info under some pretense.</p>\n<h2>Who do phishing emails target?</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, no one is safe from phishing attempts by online scammers. As soon as your email address is public somewhere out there, scammers can find it and start sending phishing emails to you.</p>\n<p>That being said, some scammers prefer to target members of medium to large organizations because they can try to make emails appear to be from a coworker or a department within the organization.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Phishers have even been known to target CEOs and board members of organizations because they are high value targets.</p>\n<p>The key takeaway here is that no email address &mdash; whether it&rsquo;s your personal or work email &mdash; is safe from phishing attempts.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/a4bc5453c5009142646d7c1cf3ada232.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/a4bc5453c5009142646d7c1cf3ada232.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"389\"></picture></p>\n<h2>5 tips for recognizing phishing attempts (phishing email examples)</h2>\n<h3>1.The email requests sensitive information&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>This is a dead giveaway because legitimate companies will never request your sensitive information via email.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One way a fake email attempting to steal information from you may do so by saying an account you have for a legit company has been hacked and they need you to provide your login information to retrieve it.</p>\n<p>For example, the email might say something like:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;Dear user, your account has been locked because of a hacking attempt. We need your username and password to retrieve your account.&rdquo;</i></p>\n<p>The email might ask for you to respond directly with your login details or provide a link for you to click on and enter your info. Again, a legit email from a real company should never request sensitive information from you.</p>\n<h3>2.The email address is not from the company&rsquo;s domain</h3>\n<p>This is another easy way to spot a fake email attempting to steal your data is by looking at the domain the email was sent from. Major companies all send emails from a legit company domain.</p>\n<p>For example, a legit email from Amazon&rsquo;s customer service would come from the domain:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;@amazon.com.&rdquo;</i>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A fake email pretending to be Amazon could come from a domain like:</p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;@customerservicexyz.com.&rdquo;</i></p>\n<p>While fake domains are often pretty obvious, it can sometimes be hard to <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/12-easy-ways-to-check-if-a-website-is-legit-or-a-scam/\">distinguish fake domains from real ones</a> if you don&rsquo;t already know what the real one is. Phishers can send emails from domains with company names in them that look similar to the legit domains.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you ever have any doubts about the legitimacy of an email&rsquo;s domain, do some research about it to try and determine if it is real.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can do this by either Googling the domain a suspicious email comes from or by Googling a few lines from the body of the email to see if it pulls up any info about a known phishing attack.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can also look at past emails from a company to see what domain they come from so you know how to spot phishing emails attempting to trick you into thinking they&rsquo;re from that company.</p>\n<h3>3.The email contains spelling/grammatical errors</h3>\n<p>The odd typo is not unheard of in legit emails, but if you receive a suspicious email with all kinds of grammatical and spelling errors in it, that&rsquo;s a sure sign of a phishing attack.</p>\n<p>Official communications from big companies are written by people who speak English as a native language and pass through a review process to catch any errors, so they should be pretty polished by the time they arrive in your inbox.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For example, a phishing email with incorrect spelling and grammar might read something like:</p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;Dear sirs, we have informed that your accounts informations is needed to be update now. Please provided us with your login and pasword to continue the using of your accout.&rdquo;</i></p>\n<p>Even if a phishing email doesn&rsquo;t have any glaring spelling or grammatical errors, there&rsquo;s a good chance it will just sound plain weird. If you think the language of an email doesn&rsquo;t sound professional or the word choice seems strange, there&rsquo;s a good chance it&rsquo;s phishing.</p>\n<h3>4.The email contains attachments</h3>\n<p>Emails from legit companies will never send you unsolicited attachments. Phishing emails, on the other hand, often include an attachment and request you to click on it to download it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For example, a phishing email might say something like:</p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;Please download the attached file to update your account information.&rdquo;</i></p>\n<p>Then, there will be an attachment that could be named something like:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;Updateinfo89543.html&rdquo;</i></p>\n<p>The bottom line is: never click on any attachments you&rsquo;re not expecting to receive. They can install malware on your device to steal your data.</p>\n<h3>5.The email has suspicious links</h3>\n<p>Similarly to attachments, phishing scams will often attempt to get you to click on links that take you to a fake site or install spyware on your system.</p>\n<p>Phishers can use many different pretenses to try and get you to click on such links.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For example, you might receive an email from a &ldquo;travel agency&rdquo; informing you that you&rsquo;ve &ldquo;won&rdquo; a free vacation.</p>\n<p>The email might say something along the lines of:</p>\n<p><i>&ldquo;Dear winner. You have been selected to spend 3 nights at a Caribbean resort. You MUST click on the link below to claim your prize.&rdquo;</i></p>\n<p>Once you click on the link, it might just automatically download malware onto your computer that can log your data, or it might take you to a fake site that asks you to enter personal information, like your ID and credit card numbers.</p>\n<p>Never click on links in unsolicited emails or in emails that aren&rsquo;t from people or organizations you trust.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>We hope these phishing email examples have given you a better idea of what to watch out for to protect yourself from phishing attacks.&nbsp;</p>\n",

There are a few different methods you can try to get your money back. In this article, we&rsquo;ll tell you all about how you can recover your <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/binary-options-scams/\">money from a binary options scam</a>.</p>\n<h2>How do binary options scams work?</h2>\n<p>Binary options scams often attract their victims by advertising their fraudulent trading platforms on social media, via email, or cold calling. They usually promise investors low risks and high returns.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When you click on one of these ads, you&rsquo;ll be taken to a site that looks legit, which is why so many people fall victim to binary options scams.</p>\n<p><strong>There are 3 common ways that the fraudsters typically scam users out of their money.

They&rsquo;ll distort the prices and payouts of binary options until it appears that you legitimately lost money on a trade.</p>\n<p>Finally, another way some binary options scams work is by collecting your personal data (i.e. credit card info and identification info) and using it to directly steal money from your credit cards or bank accounts.</p>\n<p><strong>Tips to avoid being scammed by binary options sites and brokers:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Watch out for investment marketing that sounds too good to be true</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Always read the fine print (i.e. terms and conditions) on investment sites</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Don&rsquo;t trust brokers who call you and encourage you to deposit more funds</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Never provide your financial account numbers or ID for unspecified purposes</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Be wary of investing advice on forums (sometimes they are linked to fraud sites)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/c4fdbb96772bd47f168b6dd83f7a48f7.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/c4fdbb96772bd47f168b6dd83f7a48f7.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"389\"></picture></p>\n<p>There are plenty of reputable, registered binary option investment brokers and trading platforms out there. If you&rsquo;re ever having any doubts about a particular brokerage or platform, do your research about it and check their registration status, or simply look for a different one.</p>\n<p>Here are just a few examples of brokers and sites that are <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/blacklisted-brands/\">binary option scammers</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">AlldayOption</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Anyoption</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Banc De Binary</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Binex</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Byrix.com</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fenix-Option</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">MFX Broker</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Migesco</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">OptionTime</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Titan Trade</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How to get your money back from a binary options scam: 3 options</h2>\n<h3>1. Chargeback</h3>\n<p>As soon as you realize you&rsquo;ve become a victim of a binary options scam, the first thing you can try is getting your <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/a-guide-to-chargebacks-recover-your-funds-after-a-scam/\">money back through a chargeback</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This means contacting your credit card company to explain the situation and see if they can reverse the charges to your card that you made through a fraudulent trading platform or brokerage.</p>\n<p>This is often the easiest option because you only have to deal with your bank or credit card company. Keep in mind that you usually have to try and claim a chargeback within 120 days of when you realized you were scammed.</p>\n<p>Claiming a chargeback requires you to write a letter to your card issuer explaining your case.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Make sure to include all the fraudulent charges and their dates, the total amount of money you want charged back, and the name of the binary options trading platform or broker that scammed you.</p>\n<p>You should also include any additional evidence you have, such as copies of emails you sent attempting to contact the fraudulent company about releasing your funds.</p>\n<h3>2. File a Claim</h3>\n<p>The second option you have to get your money back from a binary options scam is to file a legal complaint against the broker or start a lawsuit. The best way to do this is to find a reputable lawyer who has experience with this type of litigation to help you through the process.</p>\n<p>A good lawyer may be able to find out the real names of the people behind the scam to hit them with a lawsuit and get your money back. They may also be able to follow the money to the bank where the scammers keep it and put pressure on the bank to give you back your funds.</p>\n<h3>3.

The median loss reported by those who were scammed is $1,900.</p>\n<p>Though still considered a highly unstable form of currency by investors, cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly normalized as celebrities back them and large corporations even start to accept them as forms of payments.</p>\n<p>As the prevalence of crypto grows, scammers have been coming up with different ways to rob investors of their cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In one scam, the fraudsters pose as celebrities and dupe investors into sending them cryptocurrencies with a promise that they will get their currencies back with a return on their investment. Of course, the victims never see their money again.</p>\n<p>The top celebrities crypto scammers have posed as over the past year are Elon Musk, John McAfee, and Yusaku Maezawa.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another technique scammers are using is to post fake investment tips online (on scam sites, social media, or investment tip forums) that direct unsuspecting investors to fraudulent sites that promise a big return on investment (ROI) if they deposit funds.</p>\n<p>A third tactic fraudsters employ is to pose as someone from a government agency like the social security administration and request a payment in the form of Bitcoin or another popular cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/8a904b64728ae288551624990de51582.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/8a904b64728ae288551624990de51582.jpg\" width=\"512\" height=\"341\"></picture></p>\n<p>Crypto scammers will even play with your heart to trick you out of your cryptocurrencies.

This opens up a whole new world of opportunities for scammers to take advantage of them.</p>\n<p>Whereas traditional investments are harder to get scammed on (people 50 and older are less likely to fall victim to crypto scams), the world of crypto is still unregulated and highly volatile. You can think of it kind of like the &ldquo;Wild West&rdquo; of investing.</p>\n<p>Because of the lack of regulation and constantly changing landscape, there is also a fair amount of &ldquo;FOMO,&rdquo; or &ldquo;fear of missing out,&rdquo; for crypto investors. One day a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin might shoot up $30,000 in value, and the next it can come crashing down again.</p>\n<p>This FOMO creates a lot of pressure to buy or sell certain cryptocurrencies in the heat of the moment, without thinking too much about the decision. Because of this, it&rsquo;s easy for scammers to create a sense of urgency and trick investors out of their money.</p>\n<p>Fraudsters can set up cryptocurrency investing sites that look legitimate, load them up with crypto jargon, and require users to create an account into which they deposit their cryptocurrencies in hopes of earning a big ROI.</p>\n<p>Since crypto investing is so new, it&rsquo;s important to be very careful about where you store and transfer your funds.</p>\n<h2>Is there hope for those who were scammed?</h2>\n<p>If you or someone you know has fallen victim to a crypto scam, there is some hope.

            "content": "<p>PayPal has positioned itself as probably the most popular online payment system since it started out back in 1998. Whether to provide a platform for those who have their own online businesses, send money between family members across countries, or to have a faster, more secure way of making transactions online: it&rsquo;s easy to see why more than 360 million people use it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But, as to be expected, it&rsquo;s long been a way for scammers to try and part people with their hard-earned cash, whether it&rsquo;s through phishing or the PayPal friends and family scam. Keep reading to learn about the different types of scams and what you can do to get your money back should you become the next victim.</p>\n<h2>Can You Get Scammed On PayPal?</h2>\n<p>The simple answer? Yes. It&rsquo;s possible to get scammed almost anywhere online, and PayPal is no exception. There are various ways in which it can be done, and many of them rely on naivety and failure on your part for them to work. Even simple steps on your part can help to prevent this from happening, such as verifying the amount being requested, as well as a seller&rsquo;s details.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In order to properly protect yourself from the types of PayPal fraud out there, you&rsquo;ll first need to know what they are. Read on to learn more about them.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>6 Common Paypal Scams</h2>\n<h3>1. Scam Email</h3>\n<p>If you find an email in your inbox addressed from PayPal, though unlikely, there&rsquo;s a chance it&rsquo;s come from a fraudulent source. It&rsquo;ll likely ask you to follow the link embedded in the PayPal scam email, either because it needs you to prove your login details or there&rsquo;s a problem with your account, and then you&rsquo;ll get phished; which leads to the next point.</p>\n<h3>2. Phishing</h3>\n<p>PayPal phishing is successful simply because you&rsquo;ve handed over your sensitive information, like your login details, to gain access to your account and empty your balance. This is usually done via email, and you&rsquo;d be surprised how simple it is to fall for. The PayPal scam email you&rsquo;re sent will likely look identical to any the company would send you.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>3. Fake Shipping Address</h3>\n<p>This scam starts with a person paying for an item with a fake delivery address. When the shipping company rejects delivery several times, they make contact and change it to a valid one, without informing PayPal. They then tell PayPal that the item was undelivered and get a refund, leaving the seller without their goods and no money to show for it.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>4. Over Pay Scam</h3>\n<p>A scam buyer may send too much money for an item they order to then request the overpayment back. Once this is received, they&rsquo;ll then tell PayPal that their account has been hacked or compromised and issue a refund for the full amount. That means you, the seller, have lost out on the amount that was originally overpaid.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>5. Friends and Family Scam</h3>\n<p>PayPal Friends and Family, sadly, leaves people open to a lot of scamming potential for one main reason: the payments are non-refundable. Often, fake sellers will try to convince you to send your money via this method, ensuring that, should you comply, you won&rsquo;t be able to reclaim your funds and there&rsquo;s nothing that PayPal can or will do anything about it.&nbsp; The Paypal Friends and Family Scam is one to look out for.</p>\n<h3>6. Advance Payment Scam</h3>\n<p>If anyone offers you free money, alarm bells should be ringing &#8211; especially if it&rsquo;s a stranger online. You certainly wouldn&rsquo;t be so trustworthy if it was a person on the street. If you&rsquo;re promised vast amounts of money, likely on the basis that you&rsquo;ve won a competition, the fraudster may ask that you first send a small fee, <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/tax-season-scams/\">probably for &ldquo;tax purposes&rdquo;</a>, before they send you your winnings. You won&rsquo;t see a penny after that, nor will you hear from this person again.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Does PayPal Refund Money If You&rsquo;re Scammed?&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>The first thing you should do following a scam is to place a PayPal fraud report. Though it doesn&rsquo;t actually replace the funds itself, it does enable you to refund money for issues like items not being sent/received, or if you suspect fraud. As mentioned above, though, this is what leaves room for scammers to take hold of your funds, so it&rsquo;s a double-edged sword. What&rsquo;s more, if you use the family and friends feature, you rule out PayPal&rsquo;s refund abilities altogether. Even in the event of scams, there are various examples online of frustrated users that are left out of pocket with no recourse.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, you don&rsquo;t need to fret too much, frantically calling PayPal&rsquo;s customer services and sending multiple emails hoping for a quick response. You&rsquo;ll be able to process a refund yourself in the dashboard, and this will no doubt move much quicker than even getting through to the support team on your first attempt at calling.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>How To Get Your Money Back From PayPal If You&rsquo;re Scammed</h2>\n<p>Be sure to follow the process and act quickly, as the longer your money is in the hands of scammers, the less likely you are to get it back. Plus, PayPal&rsquo;s powers don&rsquo;t extend beyond its software, so should the money be withdrawn and sent to a bank account, there&rsquo;s essentially nothing the platform can do at that point.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/\">PayBack</a>, we&rsquo;ve been working for years in the <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/a-guide-to-chargebacks-recover-your-funds-after-a-scam/\">chargeback industry</a>, returning more than one million dollars to the people that they belong to.

            "content": "<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest, who doesn&rsquo;t do online shopping these days? Brick-and-mortar locations have definitely felt the blow over the years, which is why they all have an online presence. Those that don&rsquo;t have either long since faded out or likely don&rsquo;t have long left. Even grocery stores made the move in recent years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But with every consumer trend comes a scheme to follow, and that&rsquo;s why online shopping fraud is a massive problem. In 2018 alone, the FTC reported the loss of almost $1.5 billion to internet sales scams. Read on to learn more about how to tell if an online store is safe, online shopping scams, and what the right course of action is should they happen to you.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>What Is An Online Shopping Scam?</h2>\n<p>The practice is exactly what the name suggests: anyone that purchases something from a fraudulent seller, doesn&rsquo;t receive their goods, and has their money stolen has fallen victim to an online shopping scam. Knowing how to spot the types of scams, though, starts with understanding the most common types:&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Classified Scams</h3>\n<p>The classified scam can often be rather dangerous. Using websites like Craiglist to purchase goods, meeting a person, and having your money stolen could see you get seriously injured. Let&rsquo;s be honest, you put a lot of trust into strangers when you purchase something without the protection of regulation and legitimacy. Proving that you&rsquo;ve been scammed in this way might even be difficult to prove. That&rsquo;s why you should never hand any money over without getting the goods, just be cautious when meeting with people you don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Illegitimate Retailers</h3>\n<p>The technology available means it&rsquo;s easy to set up scam online stores that easily replicate legitimate ones, tricking people into paying for goods they&rsquo;ll never receive. The easiest way to notice identify these is that despite having the same logo, layout, graphics, and everything else, the methods of payment will be different. Expect to see wire transfers, pre-loaded gift cards, or some sort of money order as the required methods. This is what ensures you won&rsquo;t be able to recall any of the money you&rsquo;ve spent.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Medical Products</h3>\n<p>It&rsquo;s not uncommon that people will turn to the internet in order to find their much-needed medication for a lesser price. This is exactly what lures people in. It&rsquo;s a sorry state of affairs when the people most in need and desperate are being deprived of their money, especially when the money they&rsquo;ve wasted on a scam is meant to ensure their quality of life.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>How To Tell If An Online Store Is Safe</h2>\n<h3>1. HTTPS</h3>\n<p>If a website has an SSL certificate, with the URL beginning with HTTPS instead of just HTTP, you can rest assured that it&rsquo;s encrypted and safe to use. <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/12-easy-ways-to-check-if-a-website-is-legit-or-a-scam/\">Scam websites</a> aren&rsquo;t able to fake this and as such, will never have that little padlock in the far left of the URL bar.&nbsp; Though some sites don&rsquo;t have them simply because they&rsquo;re outdated and poorly maintained, every online retailer will, and simply has to for trust purposes and to be able to compete.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>2. Read Online Reviews</h3>\n<p>Be sure to see what other customers have to say before rushing into any purchases. There are plenty of trustworthy sites out there like Trustpilot where, with a simple name check, you can learn about consumer experiences. Customer support, reliability, and a general rating are all available &#8211; and if you don&rsquo;t find the website on there, there&rsquo;s a good chance that it can&rsquo;t be trusted with your money&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>3. Verify Through Third-Party Websites&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>There are plenty of review sites out there that&rsquo;ll take the time to explore the services available and give their opinions. Not just that, but certain accreditations exist to give validation to online retailers. If you don&rsquo;t find yours with any of these accreditations, from the BBB, for example, you&rsquo;re likely dealing with a scam retailer.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>4. Check The Privacy Policy</h3>\n<p>The privacy policy is where you find out what a company does with your data, what data it takes, and how it protects it. If there&rsquo;s no information in there about how you&rsquo;ll be protected, or if you find that it&rsquo;s improperly written &#8211; with no clear attempt at legalese &#8211; you should take that as a warning sign/</p>\n<h3>5. Look For Contact Information</h3>\n<p>No scammer will want to give you a direct line to their home or place of work, so be sure to check for contact information. You&rsquo;ll likely find there&rsquo;s just an email address rather than nothing, but it can&rsquo;t hurt to try it out before making purchasing. Really, though, there are so many trusted retailers out there that it&rsquo;s probably not worth taking the risk anyway.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>What To Do If You&rsquo;ve Been Scammed Online Shopping&nbsp;</h2>\n<h3>1. Call Your Bank Or Credit Card Company&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve been scammed, the first thing you should do is get in touch with your bank and cancel your card. They&rsquo;ll put you through to the fraud response team who&rsquo;ll look to get your money back as well as identify those that have scammed you. You always stand the chance that this may not be possible, however, as the banks will be working on a number of cases alongside your own.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>2. File An Online Complaint</h3>\n<p>There are plenty of organizations out there that work only to protect consumers from fraudulent entities. Many of them are non-profits and will bring legal action against companies that responsible for scamming on a wide scale. Chances are, you&rsquo;ve been caught out by a website that&rsquo;s hit many other people too, so they&rsquo;ll no doubt be keen to hear about your case.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>3. Get Your Money Back&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Payback is a focused team of <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/\">chargeback experts</a> that works tirelessly to get people the money that&rsquo;s been wrongly taken from them. Once we hear your case, you&rsquo;ll have us at your full disposal, collecting all the evidence and approaching the entity responsible for taking your money.

File A Police Report</h3>\n<p>Given that fraud is a crime, after all, you should file a report with the police. It might be a slow process since your call will need to be put through to the relevant departments, but you&rsquo;ll likely find that this could expedite processes with fraud-stopping companies and offer them a much more rounded case study to act from.&nbsp;</p>\n",

That&rsquo;s because 1 in 10 profiles is a scam. And this isn&rsquo;t the only place you need to look &#8211; just check your spam folder in your email inbox. In 2019 alone, phishing attempts rose by 65%; imposter fraud is responsible for just shy of $500 million each year. The list really does go on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There are steps you can take, as an everyday internet user, to know how to tell if a website is legit, as well as protect yourself and ensure you&rsquo;re never made a victim of fraud or hacking.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>12 Ways To Check If A Website Is Legit</h2>\n<h3>1. Check URLs Carefully:</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, it can be all too easy to mistype or fail to notice the slightest difference from a legit URL. That&rsquo;s precisely what scam sites are banking on here. Many sites are made to perfectly mimic the real Facebook, for example, in order to phish your details. Use a <a href=\"https://www.urlvoid.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">scam website checker</a> if you&rsquo;re ever unsure.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/5c668387ad6e217d775203a151d09e4c.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/5c668387ad6e217d775203a151d09e4c.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"51\"></picture></p>\n<h3>2. SSL Certificates:</h3>\n<p>An SSL certificate is what gives you the little padlock in the top left of your URL bar. It&rsquo;s also what turns a website from HTTP to HTTPS. All eCommerce, online banking, social media sites &#8211; or any that wants to be trustworthy &#8211; will have an SSL certificate. HTTPS is much more secure and should appease anyone wondering &lsquo;is this website legit?&rsquo;. Sites like Payback can help should you fall foul to a broker that doesn&rsquo;t have SSL encryption, for example.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/5f313d68a8fc960e0db94006021f11ae.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/5f313d68a8fc960e0db94006021f11ae.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"37\"></picture></p>\n<h3>3. View Certificate Details:</h3>\n<p>If you want to see for yourself if an SSL certificate is legit, you need only click the padlock in the URL bar and hit &lsquo;View Certificate&rsquo;. This will show you when the certificate was added to the website. And for added peace of mind, this can&rsquo;t be faked &#8211; it&rsquo;s displayed by your browser and added by the site&rsquo;s hosting company.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/58825231206c1a8a2a67009b618e6648.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/58825231206c1a8a2a67009b618e6648.jpg\" width=\"340\" height=\"152\"></picture></p>\n<h3>4. Check Contact Information:</h3>\n<p>No scam website is going to give out their own contact information, but go careful: they&rsquo;ll likely use the same details of the site they&rsquo;re the impostor of. You can always use these details to verify the website for yourself, or simply run the URL checker for a proper website review.</p>\n<h3>5. Read The About Us Page:</h3>\n<p><b> </b>Companies like to scream from the rooftops about their heritage, as well as the journey that led them to where they are now. Even if they haven&rsquo;t been live long, you&rsquo;ll still find it there. The absence of this information is a massive red flag &#8211; you&rsquo;ll likely want to avoid that website.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>6. Look For A Privacy Policy and Read It:</h3>\n<p>It&rsquo;s common to not read <a href=\"https://consumercal.org/about-cfc/cfc-education-foundation/what-should-i-know-about-privacy-policies-2/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">privacy policies</a> &#8211; we&rsquo;re all guilty of it. But if you&rsquo;re doubting the integrity of a website, you should check to see if it even has one. If it does, read it. You&rsquo;ll soon find out whether a website is authentic or not when you see how the owners approach legalese.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>7. Read Online Reviews:</h3>\n<p>Word of mouth is a powerful thing, and people like to share their experiences &#8211; often, it&rsquo;s to vent, not to warn others. But a lot can be learned by what other people have to say about your suspected scammer, so check popular <a href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/payback-ltd.com\">review websites</a>.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/d6774c243c7e919d121b0ff3e9dfddcf.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/d6774c243c7e919d121b0ff3e9dfddcf.jpg\" width=\"450\" height=\"81\"></picture></p>\n<h3>8. Can The Site Be Verified On Social Media?:</h3>\n<p>Social presence is important for building an audience or readership, and can do wonders for online popularity. That isn&rsquo;t to say every company or site owner has social profiles but plenty to do. Check popular social media sites and see how active their profiles are, as well as when they were established.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>9. Look For Trust Badges:</h3>\n<p>Trust badges offer a surefire way for websites to prove their legitimacy. All major eCommerce websites will have them, displayed pride of place so as not to prevent any potential sales. They&rsquo;re also used to promote USPs. Be sure that these can be verified, however.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>10. Check Domain Ages:</h3>\n<p>The length of domain ownership can show you not only when it was purchased but also when since when it was made active. What&rsquo;s more, you can see the platform that hosts it, and look to verify this also. Use a <a href=\"https://www.duplichecker.com/domain-age-checker.php\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">domain checker</a> to learn all you need to.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>11. Spelling and Grammar:</h3>\n<p>The longer a scammer spends on the finer details, the longer they have to wait to unleash their scam. Plus, the teams running these nefarious websites are often small, so the small details like spelling and grammar tend to be overlooked. You wouldn&rsquo;t see a spelling mistake on your online banking platform, would you?</p>\n<h3>12. If It Doesn&rsquo;t Seem Right, Don&rsquo;t Risk It:</h3>\n<p>For all the reasons above, and any others you can think of &#8211; gut feeling, even- don&rsquo;t bother with it. Anything you&rsquo;re looking for can be found elsewhere anyway, whether it&rsquo;s online shopping, social media, news, or anything else.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>What To Do If You Get Scammed</h3>\n<p>If you find that you&rsquo;ve been scammed by a website, whether it&rsquo;s a <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/forex-scams/\">forex broker</a>, <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/binary-options-scams/\">binary options scammer</a>, or any other type of fraud, get your <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/contact-us/\">free consultation with Payback</a> today.

            "content": "<p>Since virtually everything about our way of life moved online, you wouldn&rsquo;t be blamed for assuming that mail fraud wouldn&rsquo;t be as common as it used to be. Actually, it&rsquo;s a method that&rsquo;s still commonly used in scamming attempts today.</p>\n<p>In 2020 alone, the FTC received more than two million reports of mail fraud from consumers, naming imposter scams as the most common types forwarded through the world&rsquo;s oldest form of long-distance communication.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Been scammed or want to be prepared should it happen to you? Keep reading to learn more about mail fraud, the types to expect, and how you can report it.</p>\n<h2>What Constitutes Mail Fraud?</h2>\n<p>Mail fraud simply refers to any type of attempted fraud that&rsquo;s submitted via the postal system. In the US, this constitutes as a federal and serious crime, not least for the damage it causes. Since it crosses both state and international lines, any mail fraud penalty will be severe, carrying a maximum of $1 million in fines and and up to 30 years in prison.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The three markers of mail fraud are:&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Depriving Someone</h3>\n<p>The act of committing mail fraud isn&rsquo;t complete without depriving someone of the thing they&rsquo;ve worked the hardest for: their money. Manipulation and reliance on the naivety and good will of others are essential components when it comes to parting people with their money, so as you can imagine, it takes a real special breed of person to turn to scamming, no matter how desperate people can be.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Scheme To Defraud</h3>\n<p>For any plan to succeed, there has to be a strategy in place. Over time, there&rsquo;s been a range of tried-and-tested ways of committing both local and international mail fraud, many of which you&rsquo;ve likely heard of.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A typical scheme will create a sense of urgency or fear on the part of the receiver, either to send over banking details or to directly forward money via an untraceable payment system like Western Union. The scammer will likely imitate an official company you&rsquo;re affiliated with or imitate a charity or an organization running a competition.</p>\n<h3>The Use Of Mail</h3>\n<p>As mentioned above and no doubt the most obvious marker, the postal system has to be used for any such scam to be labelled as mail fraud. This is especially important because it&rsquo;s what enables a government to punish mail fraud cases. If it&rsquo;s committed over the phone or, in most cases, via email, and money is forwarded to the fraudster, it&rsquo;s likely that no charges will be brought forward.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Common Examples Of Mail Fraud</h2>\n<h3>Ponzi Schemes</h3>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a reason we shouldn&rsquo;t trust everything we hear, and that&rsquo;s an especially important rule in business. Ponzi schemes date as far back to the mid 1800s, even before the name was coined. Under the impression of buying into the next-best business opportunity, innocent people are suckered into parting with their cash on several occasions, simply to line the pockets of the so-called &lsquo;Ponzi&rsquo;, who then cuts and runs. This is one of the most common mail fraud scams there is.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Identity Theft</h3>\n<p>It can all go wrong in no time at all when it comes to identity theft, and a surprisingly small amount of information is needed to execute it. A few biographical details is all they need to take out loans in your name, to clear out your bank accounts, and to even commit criminal acts in your name. Due to the slow-moving nature of the postal system, by the time your accounts are cleared and you&rsquo;re being hauled in for charges, the scammers are already eyeing up their next mark.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Fraudulent Documentation</h3>\n<p>This could be any documentation that requires forwarding money directly to a sender or, more likely, handing over your banking details. The letters will look just like anything you&rsquo;d expect to see from your ISP or car insurance policy provider, except they serve only to part you with your personal information. This is one of the common methods used for stealing a person&rsquo;s identity, also.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Tips To Protect Yourself<b></b></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n \t    Don&#8217;t Leave Bills In Your Mailbox:<br />\nLeaving mail with personal information on it, like bills, is exactly how scammers know what types of fraudulent documentation to send you, how they commit identity fraud, and how they pick you as the person for their next scam. Be sure to get your mail as soon as possible, and this goes for sending too: don&rsquo;t trust anyone to get your post where it needs to go.</li>\n<li>\n        Don&#8217;t Respond To Suspicious Letters:<br />\nThis is mail fraud 101. Anything you&rsquo;re unsure of, the last thing you want to do is hand over your personal details or banking information. You wouldn&rsquo;t do this with a suspicious person, would you? If you&rsquo;re ever unsure, simply give a quick call to the company that a letter claims to be sent by and get confirmation first. Usually, you&rsquo;ll know to expect any mail from a company anyway.</li>\n<li>\n        Be Careful What Sensitive Information You Send In The Mail:<br />\nMost of our commitments with banking, policy payments, and anything similar can be handled online these days. Do you need to use the post? You should try to avoid putting anything personal in the post whenever possible</li>\n<li>\n        Take Note If Anything Seems To Be Missing From Your Mailbox:<br />\nIf you&rsquo;re expecting a letter and it hasn&rsquo;t shown up, double check with the sender to make sure it was actually forwarded. If it was, consider changing the details attached to the respective account.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How To Report Mail Fraud</h2>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re a victim of mail fraud, you should always report it to the fraud organizations in your country to aid them in shutting the scammer down. That being said, you&rsquo;re unlikely to see your money back since the process is far too slow-moving.&nbsp;</p>\n",

How the SEC protects investors and the importance of their oversight</strong></p>\n<p>There are many steps that investors can take to protect themselves against fraud. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a government agency committed to protecting all Americans from securities fraud, which includes misrepresentations made by brokerage firms regarding investments or financial products.</p>\n<p>The SEC has been successful in prosecuting individuals who have perpetrated such crimes, yet there remains room for improvement when it comes to enforcement efforts surrounding investment advisers and other intermediates. This poses a challenge as these intermediaries often receive incentives for bringing new clients into fund management businesses. A lack of action on this front could facilitate more investor victimization while also creating an uneven playing field within the markets with individual brokers driven less by ethics than competition-driven monetary interests.</p>\n<p><strong>2. The difference between fraud and manipulation</strong></p>\n<p>There is a significant difference between fraud and manipulation. Fraud is when a broker makes false claims about the value of an investment. Manipulation, on the other hand, is when brokers use various tactics to get their own trades executed at favorable prices or to prevent any unfavorable execution for themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>3. When to report securities fraud to the SEC</strong></p>\n<p>If you believe you&#8217;ve been a victim of <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/stock-trading-scams/\">securities fraud</a>, there are a few things you should do. First, document what happened and how much money was lost as well as the date and time of your investment. Next, call or email the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) to report securities fraud by submitting a complaint form online: <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/tcr\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.sec.gov/tcr</a></p>\n<p><strong>4. Examples of fraudulent activity in financial markets</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately the list of frauds in the financial markets is endless, ranging from outright theft to widespread manipulation and insider trading.</p>\n<p>The following are some examples of fraudulent activity in financial markets:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Touting stocks by publishing false information about a company or its prospects</li>\n<li>Falsely reporting the prices at which orders were executed on an exchange for personal gain (slipping)</li>\n<li>Deliberately sending misleading signals through communications channels such as chatrooms, instant messaging services and message boards (<a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/avoid-pump-and-dump-scams/\">pump &amp; dump scheme</a>)</li>\n<li>Stealing money from trading accounts by obtaining unauthorized access using passwords obtained through social engineering techniques</li>\n<li>Siphoning funds from clients&#8217; investment portfolios with falsified balance statements</li>\n<li>Simply selling securities, when you are <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/blacklisted-brands/\">neither a registered broker or securities professional</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Recovering money from securities fraud</h2>\n<p><strong>1. How to recover money from securities fraud</strong></p>\n<p>Securities fraud is a federal crime and, as such, there are clear repercussions for those who break the law. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has established guidelines on how to <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/stock-trading-scams/\">recover money from securities fraud</a>&nbsp;that you may have lost or invested in due to the criminal activities of someone else</p>\n<p>They suggest contacting an attorney immediately after discovering suspicious activity, so they can file a complaint with FINRA&#8217;s Office of Investigations. You should also keep records about your losses so if this happens again but at another company you&#8217;ll be able to show evidence supporting your claims. This will allow them to more easily issue refunds without going through lengthy investigations themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>2. The process of recovering your money through the courts</strong></p>\n<p>The process for recovering your money can be a long and arduous one. The first step is hiring a lawyer to file an arbitration claim and being able to show evidence of the fraud</p>\n<p>The next steps could include filing for bankruptcy, which will protect your assets when creditors come knocking on your door; this is also important because you&#8217;ll need proof that you couldn&#8217;t pay back what was owed in order to avoid criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p>After obtaining legal protection, if anyone tries to collect from you, they can be sued or arrested by law enforcement agencies who have jurisdiction over these cases. You may want to check with them first before taking any action against individual debt collectors.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Why you should hire a professional</strong></p>\n<p>You could try to go it alone in recovering your money but not hiring a professional likely contributed to you being in this mess in the first place. <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/\">PayBack Ltd is a company that specializes in recovering money</a> from those who owe it to you.</p>\n<p>Their services are designed for people like you, so the chances of a successful recovery will be much higher than if you tried on your own with no specific experience or training.</p>\n<p>Rather than trying to collect the debt all by yourself and risking being taken advantage of again, <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/contact-us/\">let PayBack ltd do everything for you</a>!</p>\n",

            "content": "<p>Non-fungible tokens are a type of distributed leger token that has taken the world by storm in recent months. NFTs represent digital assets, like unique collectibles and artwork. They can be used to track ownership and provide provable scarcity for all types of items, from sports cards to home d&eacute;cor.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/cryptocurrency-scams/\">NFT scams</a> have been on the rise as well, with over $1 billion lost so far this year through fraudulent practices like fake ICOs and phishing attacks. As NFTs become more popular in mainstream markets, these scams will only continue to grow until something is done about them. We&#8217;ll explore what NFT scams are exactly, how they work, who&#8217;s being targeted most often (hint: it&#8217;s not who you&#8217;d think), and how to avoid them.</p>\n<h2>What is an NFT token and how does it relate to cryptocurrencies?</h2>\n<p>NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are digital assets that have unique properties. This means they&#8217;re not interchangeable and can&#8217;t be duplicated like traditional cryptocurrencies. Unlike a cryptocurrency&#8217;s coins with their predetermined supply limit (only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist), NFTs&#8217; value is determined by the number of people who want them for whatever it is they do.</p>\n<h2>How does an NFT token work?</h2>\n<p>An ERC-20 token contract defines what makes each coin different from another&#8211;its name, symbol, decimal amount in ETH/BTC, total supply cap etcetera&#8211;while also defining how to transfer ownership between parties on the blockchain. These technology standards allow any Ethereum address to store multiple types of coins, each of which is differentiated by a different NFT.</p>\n<p>The most popular ERC-20 token standard right now is the non-fungible Ethereum&#8217;s native currency called ETH, and this system works as long as everyone agrees on what an &#8220;ETH&#8221; actually means in terms of value or function. But if you&#8217;re designing your own tokens to represent something else&#8211;gold coins for example&#8211;then it becomes necessary to provide more detail about how they work, so that people know exactly what they can do with them.</p>\n<h2>What makes NFTs valuable?</h2>\n<p>NFTs are valuable because there aren&#8217;t very many like them out there: In this way they differ from traditional currencies which have unlimited supplies.</p>\n<p>This is where the idea of scarcity comes into play, and that&#8217;s why NFTs can be considered a type of commodity rather than just money. Scarcity creates value in any market by limiting supply to drive up demand, but with NFTs it also means you don&#8217;t know what else might crop up at some point&#8211;particularly if your NFT represents something physical such as an artwork or piece of land&#8211;so its price can continue to go up even after an initial high-value purchase. This is especially true for assets whose rarity isn&#8217;t naturally determined by nature (e.g. gold) but rather by a human-created process (e.g. money printing).</p>\n<p>NFT scams are on the rise as more people enter crypto and NFTs become a new frontier for fraudsters to explore&#8211;even though they&#8217;ve been around since 2017 when CryptoKitties became one of the first NFT games with real economic value, followed soon after by Rare Pepe Wallet cards</p>\n<p>In less than two years these non-fungible tokens have already gone mainstream: There&#8217;s an entire industry devoted to them now that includes art galleries, auctions, in-game purchases made through smart contracts, even trading card game tournaments where rare items can be worth tens of thousands or even millions of dollars.</p>\n<h2>Is NFT crypto fraud real?</h2>\n<p>So if an NFT is a digital collectible that&#8217;s not worth anything until somebody decides to buy it, then what happens when people trade them without realizing they&#8217;re worthless? Owning something risky and having its value suddenly drop is one thing, but what about the 100% purely unadulterated con artists who are playing in the NFT space.</p>\n<p>A NFT scam, which is a form of fraud that takes place in the crypto world when an unscrupulous individual sells someone something they know is not worth anything. The seller just wants to make a quick buck and will tell you whatever lies it takes for them to get your money. This sounds like a scam as old as time with an NFT they can happen faster, and be larger than anyone could&#8217;ve imagined at their outset.</p>\n<p>The best-known NFT scam targeted a game called CryptoKitties, which is the most popular NFT. The seller took some of their own &#8220;fake&#8221; cats and put them up for sale in order to drive down the value of other players&#8217; assets. This was an insider attack that involved someone who knew what they were doing&#8211;a well-meaning person would have been outed as soon as they started manipulating prices because every transaction has a publicly viewable price history on Etherscan.io, but this person had no such intention.</p>\n<p>This CryptoKitties &#8220;scam&#8221; is really just a competition for control over the price of NFTs. It can happen in many other games, too&#8211;even those with more centralized economies and less open markets&#8211;because <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/17-cryptocurrency-investment-scams-you-must-know-about/\">these kinds of scams</a> are all about manipulating prices through supply and demand. When there&#8217;s only one person or company controlling supply, monopolistic practices like this have long been known to create an opportunity for manipulation that harms consumers without any benefit to themselves. The lack of transparency around pricing makes it harder to see what&#8217;s happening because their stocks stay high-priced as they sell off inventory, creating shortages that drive up prices further still.</p>\n<h2>Why are NFTs vulnerable to scams?</h2>\n<p>Non-fungible tokens are especially vulnerable to scams because they are governed by less than open markets. The lack of transparency around pricing makes it harder to see what&#8217;s happening because their stocks stay high-priced as they sell off inventory, creating shortages that drive up prices further still.</p>\n<p>Non-fungible tokens are especially vulnerable to these types of manipulations because they are governed by open markets which means you can easily see the results in real time without going through any middlemen like an auction house. It also opens up some big questions about how we should regulate smart contracts like these so that people don&#8217;t find themselves being ripped off.</p>\n<h2>Recovering from an NFT scammer</h2>\n<p>If you find yourself taken advantage of by an NFT scam, fear not! There are organizations out there working to make NFT markets a secure space, and better yet, companies like <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/\">Payback Ltd. help get your money back</a>.</p>\n<p>Your NFT has been stolen!

            "content": "<p>What is cash app fraud? Cash App Fraud occurs when a person uses someone else&#8217;s account information to send or receive funds. It may also include the use of a stolen credit card and using it to purchase Bitcoin which is then sent to their own cash app wallet. The most common form of Cash App Fraud happens when an individual downloads the Cash App, verifies their email address with their phone number but doesn&#8217;t input any other personal information. This leaves them vulnerable as they can be bombarded with spam messages from scammers posing as Cash App representatives who are requesting additional verification information in order for them to &#8220;verify&#8221; your account (i.e., your name, date-of-birth).</p>\n<h2>How does Cash App work?</h2>\n<p>Users download the Cash App for either iOS or Android devices. They sign up using their email address and phone number to create a Cash App account that is verified by a six-character password, PIN code, and touch ID on iPhones. Once this is done, they can then use cash app&#8217;s services: Send funds to anyone with an email; request money from friends via text message or through social media posts (Facebook Messenger).</p>\n<p>Some of the benefits of using cash app are that it is free to use. There are no fees for sending money or converting from cash to digital currency within the Cash App account as long as it&#8217;s under $20,000 and not connected with a bank transfer. Cash app allows you access your funds anytime &#8211; even without an internet connection!</p>\n<p>The downsides to cash app are that you have to pay a fee for transferring money from your Cash App account to a bank account. You also have to find someone with cash app who will buy bitcoin in order to purchase items that are not available on the mobile marketplaces.</p>\n<p>Cash app is linked directly, and has access, with Square&#8217;s credit card processing system which helps make it easier for customers without traditional bank accounts or checks. This leads into some of the risks: passwords can be used by hackers if they &#8220;guessed&#8221; or were given them; there is no protection against fraud &#8211; whether via email scams (phishing)or stolen credentials because all information including username/email address/pin code/touch ID is stored remotely.</p>\n<h2>Can you be scammed on Cash App?</h2>\n<p>Scammers can easily pose as Cash App employees or users and contact you to request your personal information</p>\n<h3><b>What can I do to protect myself?</b></h3>\n<p>Don&#8217;t give out sensitive information on the app if they ask for it; verify that a message is from an official Cash App account by checking the blue checkmark next to their name.</p>\n<p>Fraudsters pretend to be Cash App and they say they need your password or PIN so they can steal your money. Some scam artists will outright ask for personal information and others work up to it; this is how fraudsters get themselves authorized to take your money. Never share your Cash App information with anyone!</p>\n<h3><b>How long does cash app verification take?</b></h3>\n<p>Cash App will send you a text message with a code once your identity has been verified using this method. Once you&#8217;ve received that text, copy it into the box found within Settings &#8211; Security &amp; Privacy &#8211; Verified Phone Numbers and press &#8220;Verify&#8221;. Then click &#8220;Confirm&#8221;.</p>\n<h3><b>What happens if you get tricked or scammed on Cash App?</b></h3>\n<p>If you get scammed on Cash App, know that you are not alone. Scams on Cash App have been on the rise, including fraudulent cash-outs as well as spoof emails and text messages that appear to be from Cash App.</p>\n<p>Wade Hankins is a landlord based in Raleigh, North Carolina and he used the Cash App to collect rent payments from his tenants. Someone called him claiming to be from Cash App and said they would help him get his money out of the app and into his back account.&nbsp; Unfortunately, they were only helping themselves to his money.&nbsp; He lost over $20,000 to these unscrupulous thieves.&nbsp; Another man from California reported this year that scammers fooled him into creating fake refunds and then used money from his regular bank account to buy over $20,000 in bitcoin.&nbsp; Cash App fraud is real and according to Apptopia, fraud on the app is up over 300% from this time last year.</p>\n<p>If you end up getting scammed on Cash App there is very little the company can do to help you track down your money.&nbsp; They lack the resources and even the tech to track the fraudsters who tricked you.&nbsp; In essence, you&#8217;re on your own!</p>\n<p>How do I report fraud on Cash app?</p>\n<p>If you think that someone has tried to trick you into giving them money or your personal information, please change your Cash App PIN so no one can access it. Then report the incident to Cash App Support here: https://cash.app/contact</p>\n<p>Next, contact your local law enforcement agency right away so they can start their own investigation into what happened and how it could be prevented in the future.</p>\n<h2>How to protect your Cash App account from fraud?</h2>\n<p>Verify that the Cash app you downloaded is an official version of Cash App. It should say &#8220;CashApp&#8221; in green lettering on a white or grey background with no other colors or patterns.</p>\n<p>Do not respond to any messages, texts, emails, etc., requesting personal information like date-of-birth and social security number for verification purposes; this will likely be part of the scammer&#8217;s strategy to gain access to your accounts Don&#8217;t click any links in emails or texts that you weren&#8217;t expecting.</p>\n<p>Do not take the bait if your Cash App account is blocked and someone who appears to be from Cash App contacts you. If it&#8217;s a legitimate request, they will have sent an email rather than contacting you directly through social media or text messages.</p>\n<p>Always double-check before clicking on anything like links, attachments, etc., as these can often lead to malware downloads onto your device.</p>\n<p>Never share your Cash app username and password with anyone else; this includes sharing them via &#8220;email recall&#8221; within the app because this could also result in fraud taking place against your account. Remember: Sharing passwords allows criminals access to all of our accounts at once!</p>\n<h2>How to get money back from a cash app scam?</h2>\n<p>On your own there is very little you can do, and as discussed above, there is very little that the company or its employees can do &#8211; or are willing to do. That&#8217;s where professional recovery services come in. Companies that specialize in recovering lost funds from all types of fraud cases, including those involving cash app.</p>\n<p>The best way to recover your money is by contacting a recovery service even before you decide to contact Cash App customer support and asking them for their professional advice on how to go about getting back the stolen funds. These services are able to use tools that put you at a greater advantage than when trying it alone because they have been doing this type of work for years and can offer confidential help with the authorities so that justice can be served as well as get any monies owed returned quickly.</p>\n<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf1PbXbjA7s</p>\n",

            "content": "<p>The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has now officially announced that they will be banning binary options to retail investors. This means that no company in Australia can offer these services to anyone who is not a professional investor, or those with significant experience trading in this type of financial instrument.</p>\n<p>This decision is in line with the other countries who have taken similar measures, and it follows a study of binary options by ASIC. This research found that many Australian investors lost money when trading these financial products; nearly one quarter of them didn&#8217;t make back any at all. In addition to this, some people were paying more than they made for trades from brokers &#8211; which means their losses actually increased as time went on. The risk was too great for most Australians investing in binaries because there wasn&#8217;t enough protection if things go wrong.</p>\n<p>The ban has been called &#8220;a win&#8221; for consumers by experts outside the industry, but some inside argue that banning binary options may just push the market underground or into unregulated areas where control efforts are difficult or ineffective.</p>\n<h2>A quick summary:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has banned binary options</li>\n<li>ASIC Commissioner John Price said, &#8220;It is too easy for people to lose large sums of money through this type of trading&#8221;. He added that there are a number of risks associated with <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/binary-options-scams/\">binary options including the risk of fraud</a>, market manipulation, and other criminal activity</li>\n<li>Binary options providers have been given until March 21st to cease operations in Australia or face fines up to $220 million dollars</li>\n<li>They may also be required to repay any funds they have taken from Australians since October 2016</li>\n<li>If you are an investor who lost money due to fraudulent investment schemes involving binary options please contact ASIC at 1800 065 943 for assistance in recovering your losses</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>So, what are binary options?</h2>\n<p>Binary option trading is a form of investment where the value of an asset (usually shares) are predicted to go up or down by one predetermined amount. Binary options can be traded on any underlying market, such as currencies, commodities and stocks.</p>\n<p>The investor will decide how much they want to invest in the trade and then select how long their contract lasts for- anywhere between 30 seconds up to 12 months. They also need to predict if the price of the asset will rise above or drop below a certain level before it expires.</p>\n<h2>How do binary options work and why are they risky?</h2>\n<p>Binary options work by predicting if the price of an asset will rise or fall by a predetermined amount. If they are correct, then their profit is fixed and known at the time they enter into the contract.</p>\n<p>If they&#8217;re wrong, however-and prices go in the opposite direction to their prediction-they lose all of their money.</p>\n<p>The reason that this type of trading can be considered risky is because it involves substantial risk for small rewards. For every winning trade there&#8217;s likely going to be many more losing trades which could mean investors incur significant financial losses on binary options trading before ever making any real gains.</p>\n<h2>Why is the Australian Securities and Investments Commission banning them</h2>\n<p>The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has taken a significant step in protecting investors from the dangers of binary options trading. Their decision was made largely because too many Australians have been ripped off by <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/blacklisted-brands/\">unscrupulous brokers</a>.</p>\n<p>This new ruling will prohibit any company that offers or advertises investments into binary option contracts on an Australian market from operating in Australia. This ban includes all companies regardless of where they&#8217;re based, but does not extend to overseas markets such as US-based financial exchanges like NASDAQ or NYSE Arca.</p>\n<h2>The legal implications of using binary options in Australia</h2>\n<p>Some of the legal implications of the ban will be far reaching. Brokers will no longer be able to use email, telephone or social media solicitation for potential investors in the country.</p>\n<p>This new ruling is going help protect Aussie traders from these types of investments because it bans companies with bad business practices from soliciting customers via means such as marketing materials like emails, social media posts and phone.</p>\n<h2>What you can do if you&#8217;ve already invested in a binary option and want to recover your money</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve already invested in or lost money investing in binary options, it is possible to <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/if-you-get-scammed-can-you-get-your-money-back/\">recover your money</a>.</p>\n<p>First, you need to understand that <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/is-binary-options-legal-the-ins-and-outs-of-binary-trading/\">binary options are not a regulated product</a> in Australia; this means Australian regulatory authorities cannot offer investors any form of protection against fraud or scams when it comes to binary option trading.</p>\n<p>To find out which company is legitimate and trustworthy, the best thing you can do is research on reputable platforms like ASIC&#8217;s website because they list all companies that are deemed as safe investment opportunities for Aussie traders.</p>\n<p>Next, you can contact a professional <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/\">recovery company like PayBack ltd</a>, the world&#8217;s leading provider of investor recovery and support services for victims of investment fraud, with over 20 years experience in helping people who have lost money on investments they trusted or were recommended to them by binary options brokers.</p>\n<p>Its important that you get your money back, so don&#8217;t delay. <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/contact-us/\">Reach out to PayBack today</a>.</p>\n",

            "content": "<h2>Police Arrest Two &amp; End $1.7 Million Forex Scam In India</h2>\n<p>A major India-based Forex scam has seen two men arrested in Chennai for operating a sophisticated <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/is-forex-a-pyramid-scheme-what-to-look-for/\">forex Ponzi scheme</a>. The 34 and 41-year-old have been running two websites since at least 2019, ultimately scamming $1.7 million out of around 70,000 people across the country. The only reason the bust took place was that one unfortunate person lost out on the equivalent of $15,000 through the scam.</p>\n<p>To have obtained such a massive amount of cash in such a short space of time shows that not only are people not comfortable with coming forward, but many likely also don&rsquo;t even know that they&rsquo;re being scammed. Just as you&rsquo;d expect, the people that were scammed were enticed by joining a high-returning low-effort FX scheme; actually, what was happening, was that the money sent for investments was actually being sent directly into the scammers&rsquo; accounts. Part of this cash was then used to pay small amounts to investors to maintain the illusion of trading, just like with any thought-out Ponzi scheme, which is likely what allowed them to maintain the operation for so long.</p>\n<p>As I&rsquo;m sure you can imagine, this one instance of Forex scamming alone is enough to show the importance of using reputable brokers. The damage can be huge, and if the fraudsters are sophisticated enough, there&rsquo;s a good chance you might never realize that the reason for your losses can be blamed on anything but a bad market. Read on to learn more about the importance of choosing a broker wisely and how you can get your money back if you&rsquo;ve been scammed.</p>\n<h2>The Importance Of Using Reputable Brokers</h2>\n<p>India is one of the most prolific countries in the world when it comes to Ponzi schemes and other such scams, like<a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/identify-and-avoid-pyramid-schemes/\"> pyramid schemes</a>, but it&rsquo;s certainly not the only one. One of the reasons it&rsquo;s so common for people to get stung is because the people running these scams aren&rsquo;t alone &#8211; they&rsquo;re often huge networks of people, sometimes even operating out of an office building, working day in day out to get people to sign up for their schemes. Essentially, this system works by cold calling hundreds of people a day and offering a new service or asking you to switch out an existing provider for them.</p>\n<p>In the case of forex trading, these pretend brokers will lure you in by promising massive returns on small investments. Perhaps you&rsquo;re unsatisfied with your existing broker, or would like to get into trading but don&rsquo;t know enough about how to get started &#8211; all scam brokers, whether from India or not, will look to capitalize on these ways of thinking, as well as the desire that most people have: to get rich, and to get rich quick.</p>\n<p>The importance of using reputable brokers really can&rsquo;t be stressed enough. Oftentimes, knowing which brokers are reputable and which ones aren&rsquo;t is where people go wrong. That means doing your own research and using whatever advice you can get is equally essential. If you&rsquo;re enticed by outrageously low fees, ask yourself: how is a broker making its money if it&rsquo;s not charging much for transactions.</p>\n<p>Another important sign to watch out for is whether or not they use any kind of client vetting process, and if they limit the number of clients they use or not. This shows they only have money on their mind, and that doesn&rsquo;t mean making you any. If you&rsquo;re unsure about using small-scale investment brokers and would prefer to make your own trades, major platforms like Binance Academy are a good place to start.</p>\n<h2>The Easiest Way To Recover Money From A Forex Scam</h2>\n<p>Forex scams, alongside those that occur with binary options, make up such a massive percentage of the broker fraud that takes place &#8211; up to 89% &#8211; that they&rsquo;re really more common than you probably thought. If you&rsquo;ve been scammed in the past or want to know the measures that can be taken to recover lost funds, you&rsquo;ll be happy to know that at <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/\">Payback LTD</a>, we&rsquo;re experts at securing chargebacks for all types of scams.</p>\n<p>Our in-house experts and unrivaled knowledge of all the key sectors means we can confidently recover your funds; it&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve done for hundreds of others, totaling almost one billion dollars of money that we&rsquo;ve reclaimed and put back where it belongs.

            "content": "<h2>The Anatomy Of The Nigerian Scam: Past And Present</h2>\n<p>What is a Nigerian scam? Well, there&rsquo;s more than one out there, and most of us have heard about at least one kind &#8211; whether through the recurring jokes people make at its expense, or an attempt has been sent to our own inboxes. In case you haven&rsquo;t guessed it yet, we&rsquo;re talking about the <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/nigerian-prince-scam-still-fooling-people-2021/\">Nigerian prince scam</a> which, as of a 2019 study, is said to still rake in more than $700,000 every year. The chance to help struggling royalty flee their country is seemingly still an effective tale to get people to part with their cash.</p>\n<p>But as stated above, this isn&rsquo;t the only scam to come from Nigeria, and the tactics and methods used have come a long way to ensuring this remains a lucrative, mostly untraceable industry. The advanced fee scam, for example, which is also known as &lsquo;419&rsquo;, has secured over $82 Billion to date, with millions of people worldwide having been affected.</p>\n<p>Though these crimes are typically done by syndicates, lone actors aren&rsquo;t uncommon. One man, known as Raymond Abbas, is responsible for stealing $431 million through phishing scams until he was arrested; another gained $40 million by targeting Chicago-based businesses, and these are just two of the people arrested in 2020. Typically, it&rsquo;s high-achieving professionals that are the most likely to fall for these types of ploys.</p>\n<p>While some types of Nigerian scams are simple in nature, like 419 fraud, others are slightly more sophisticated, as the need to adapt strategies has become essential to the success of scams and also avoiding capture. Nigeria&rsquo;s crime watch authorities are privy to all of them. There&rsquo;s everything from fake auctions and charities to eCommerce stores meant entirely to take your cash.</p>\n<p>Read on to find out why Nigeria has so many scams and what you can do to report them and get your money back should this happen to you.</p>\n<h2>Why Does Nigeria Have So Many Scams?</h2>\n<p>There&rsquo;s no one answer to this question. Though the country is known for having a huge network of scamming operations, some operating in groups and others not, for the most part, its made up of honest, hardworking, and decent people. Without going too much into the disparity of wealth in Nigeria, a big part of why this began happening is desperation and the need to source income from somewhere. Of course, greed plays a role too.</p>\n<p>Put simply, Nigerian money scams became a thing because people fall for them. The people that started this whole thing were able to prey on people&rsquo;s best intentions and goodwill without putting hardly any effort into their attempts, and thus, a gap in the market was filled. Naturally, the network grew as more people realized what money can be made. Let&rsquo;s be honest, if you don&rsquo;t work, you can treat scamming as a full-time job, and eventually, you&rsquo;re likely to get some people to fall for your attempts.</p>\n<p>At first, all countries were pretty slow on the uptake, which meant this sort of scamming went relatively unchecked in the beginning. The money taken from targeting individuals with advanced-fee schemes pales in comparison to the amount stolen from corporations. Of course, this is what really caught the attention of organizations everywhere, not just in Nigeria itself.</p>\n<p>Now, having caught the attention of existing federal bodies, like the FBI, task forces have been set up to take down the most prolific scammers, in Nigeria and various countries that are affected. Unfortunately, though, the smaller amounts scammed from everyday people like us still go relatively unchecked by these organizations; but that isn&rsquo;t to say there aren&rsquo;t ways of retrieving your cash.</p>\n<h2>Where To Report Nigerian Internet Scams</h2>\n<p>This depends entirely on where you&rsquo;re based, but all countries will have a relevant authority that you can turn to to report your recent scamming. Reporting to the Nigerian federal authorities won&rsquo;t really get you anywhere, as they&rsquo;ll work on a cross-agency basis, and likely won&rsquo;t respond to individual cases. This may be worth a try if you&rsquo;d like to give it a go, however.</p>\n<p>Really, you&rsquo;re likely best reporting to your own federal authortiy, but don&rsquo;t get your hopes up on getting your money back. You absolutely should report it, but this will do more to put the scammer out of action and save the next person from falling for what you did.

We&rsquo;ve all been hunkered down in some place around the world due to lockdowns, and this has had a huge effect on the way we live; for some, in unimaginable ways. Something most people can agree on is that interacting with people hasn&rsquo;t been a possibility for a while now. Speaking to strangers beyond supermarket cashiers just hasn&rsquo;t been on the cards. And we&rsquo;re not all lucky enough to have people at home to keep us sane &#8211; whether that&rsquo;s family, friends, or someone we&rsquo;re in a relationship with.</p>\n<p>For most of us, finding love isn&rsquo;t easy at the best of times. During a pandemic? Anyone looking to find their life partner is forced to turn to dating apps, and not all of them are reliable or as legitimate as the big names (we all know what they are). I&rsquo;m sure we can all imagine that this can lead to some really unfortunate situations. While some of us are more privy to the ways of <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/scams-on-dating-sites-are-real-2021-guide/\">internet dating and online romance scams</a> than others, the same can&rsquo;t be said for everyone; especially those that are new to the online dating game and are slightly more desperate than others.</p>\n<p>I mean, when you consider that those over 200 million dollars were lost to romance scams in 2019 alone, you start to realize just how much love scams are a real thing. Look at Australia &#8211; of the 83 million AUD lost in 2019 to these scams, 33% of those took place on social media. So you don&rsquo;t even have to be operating on dating apps.</p>\n<h3>How Can You Tell if Someone is a Romance Scammer?</h3>\n<p>This is likely one of the most saddening online scams &#8211; people that get stung are simply looking for companionship, and have a lot of affection to give. They have so much affection to give that they&rsquo;re prepared to ignore the obvious signs that come with sharing huge amounts of cash &#8211; or any amount of cash for that matter &#8211; with people they can&rsquo;t verify to be legitimate and have never even met.<br />\nIn order to avoid these scams, you need to know what to look for. Besides the obvious &#8211; like not allowing your need for love to skew your better judgment and part with your savings &#8211; there are various signs to consider. How well a person can speak the local language of a country they pertain to be from is a huge one, for example.</p>\n<p>Anyway, look out for the telltale signs; they exist. They might be more obvious to some readers, but each one is important to include. Read on to see what they are.</p>\n<p><b>Love Is In The Air (Too Quickly):</b> If someone&rsquo;s professing their love for you quickly, keep your wits about you. This is an obvious sign of an internet love scam. You think you&rsquo;re the only person they&rsquo;re trying to get money from? They&rsquo;re trying to wrap things up as quickly as possible, and if they don&rsquo;t succeed with you, they&rsquo;re onto the next sorry soul.</p>\n<p><b>Incomplete Profiles:</b> It&rsquo;s true, some of us prefer to have as little information as possible on our profiles, and that&rsquo;s okay. But if the person you&rsquo;re talking to has a couple of sketchy, bad-quality images, and doesn&rsquo;t have localized information &#8211; like schools or places of work you&rsquo;re familiar with, stay away.</p>\n<p><b>There&rsquo;s An Emergency:</b> This is all-to-common across all online scams, especially internet romance scams. The pleasantries of getting to properly know one another are out the window because low and behold, they have a family emergency. Hospital bills; fear of eviction; travel: these are just some of the excuses you can expect, and you&rsquo;ll hear them far sooner than you should feel comfortable with. Don&rsquo;t ignore your instinct.</p>\n<h3>How To Outsmart A Romantic Scammer</h3>\n<p>Honestly, outsmarting them entirely depends on how aware you are of their practices. The key tip here isn&rsquo;t just knowing how romance scammers operate, but how your average online scammer will try and separate you from your money too. Whether it&rsquo;s a Nigerian prince scam or anything similar, you&rsquo;ll do yourself a huge favor by getting to grips with the obvious signs of any scammer.</p>\n<p>Something you&rsquo;ll notice is that the approaches used in these types of scams are remarkably similar; those that involve a scammer actually interacting with you, that is. Why? Because they&rsquo;re relying on you. Ultimately, it&rsquo;s you that has to give up your cash; it&rsquo;s you that has to go along with it and feel guilty about the circumstances they&rsquo;re telling you. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be love &#8211; most romance scammers don&rsquo;t wait long enough for you to start feeling any emotions. Feelings of loneliness, desperation, the need for human contact &#8211; this is what they&rsquo;re counting on.</p>\n<p>They rely entirely on you to be desperate for love and not wise to their ways. The best thing you can do is familiarize yourself with the telltale signs of how these scammers operate and don&rsquo;t act with your heart; use your head. Never send anyone money you don&rsquo;t know, especially when you can&rsquo;t verify their existence and their profile clearly looks shady. We all know what a real profile looks like; and, let&rsquo;s be honest, no real person on these apps is gonna ask for your money anyway.</p>\n<p>The real way to outsmart them, though, is by protecting other users. Don&rsquo;t just move on &#8211; report any profile you see to be acting this way. There&rsquo;s no doubt that they operate a massive number of profiles, but any profile you can get banned means associated email addresses, phone numbers, and social media profiles can&rsquo;t be used anymore.</p>\n<h3>What Information Does A Romance Scammer Need?</h3>\n<p>Truth be told, scammers don&rsquo;t need a lot of information from you. What they really need is for you to go well out your way to send them money. They don&rsquo;t need your bank account details for this, nor do they need any personal information.</p>\n<p>Actually, two of the most common methods you&rsquo;ll come across are sending gift card codes to the person requesting them and making direct wire transfers via Western Union Bank. Both are entirely unsolvable, so be wary when sending anyone money or credit of any kind via these methods that you&rsquo;ve never met. That isn&rsquo;t to say that every instance is a scam, it&rsquo;s just that if anyone is asking you to send money via these methods, especially so soon after matching on dating apps, you&rsquo;re really unlikely to ever see that money back.</p>\n<p>The person you&rsquo;re speaking to, who&rsquo;s asking you to hand over money during this scam, in 99% of cases, isn&rsquo;t the person you&rsquo;re looking to help anyway. Having their Western Union details won&rsquo;t help you, either, since it doesn&rsquo;t act like a real bank. A person can withdraw this money as soon as you send it and never action that account again.</p>\n<p>Now, if you get access to a real bank account, there&rsquo;s a solid chance you can redeem these funds, and that&rsquo;s where Payback LTD comes in.</p>\n<h3>Reporting A Romance Scam and Getting Your Money Back!</h3>\n<p>Just because being scammed involves romance &#8211; doesn&rsquo;t mean you should be too embarrassed to say anything about it. In fact, there are companies, like us, that might actually be able to get your money back, and we don&rsquo;t judge! We don&rsquo;t care how you got scammed or why you handed the money over &#8211; all we care about is doing what we can to get your money back</p>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/\">Payback LTD</a>, we&rsquo;ve helped countless people in your exact position get their money back.

            "content": "<h2>Chargebacks: Getting Back Your Money After Being Scammed</h2>\n<p>With the increase of online trading, as well as the reliance on the internet, we&rsquo;re perhaps more prone to scams now than ever before. The tactics used are increasingly more sophisticated, and the ways you can be scammed are multiplying. It&rsquo;s also worth noting that people of all competencies are using the web, so even some of the oldest ways of parting people with their cash are still just as effective.</p>\n<p>In instances of credit card fraud, we trust that our banks will be able to recover our money or at the very least, recredit our accounts. But what if you fall foul of a crypto scam? Or, what happens if you end up losing money through Nigerian advance-fee fraud? Read on to learn what a chargeback is and how they work.</p>\n<h3>What Is A Chargeback?</h3>\n<p>Chargebacks involve returning fees spent through a transaction, whether on a credit card, debit card, or through PayPal. In many ways, it&rsquo;s the same as claiming a refund on missold or defunct items and asking for your money back.</p>\n<p>However, not every chargeback requires some kind of transaction to have taken place, nor does it mean the amount spent is even done by you. In many cases, the amount that&rsquo;s been debited from your account is a matter of fraud, or you&rsquo;ve given it away yourself, only to find that the promise you were sold on is a scam, like a Ponzi scheme, or a bad broker that&rsquo;s misusing your investments.</p>\n<h3>How Do Chargebacks Work?</h3>\n<p>How chargebacks work is entirely different for the consumer chasing their funds and the company that&rsquo;s doing the chasing. All you need to do is reach out to the appropriate authority, hand over the evidence, and wait for the results.</p>\n<p>The company responsible for recovering your funds have to review all the evidence, ascertain whether or not fraud has taken place, confront the alleged scammers, and get the funds back. Naturally, this requires a lot of knowledge, resources, and time, so you may find yourself waiting a while. Even if fraud can be proven, getting the money back isn&rsquo;t always easy.</p>\n<h2>How Long Does A Chargeback Take? </h2>\n<p>How long it takes depends entirely on how you&rsquo;re trying to reclaim your funds. The PayPal PayPal chargeback time limit will be different from a bank chargeback, and the same goes for your credit card.</p>\n<p>The truth is, chargebacks are rather complex, and can take as long as 45 days; in some cases, they can take even longer than that. Depending on the amount of money taken, the nature of the chargeback &#8211; whether it&rsquo;s from your bank or a site like PayPal &#8211; you may even be waiting as long as six months. There is no one answer, so be sure to ask the company that&rsquo;s performing the chargeback. You might find that the amount isn&rsquo;t worth the wait, or that it&rsquo;ll come in quicker than you thought it would.</p>\n<h2>Pros and Cons of Chargebacks</h2>\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<p><b>Funds Recovery:</b> Obviously, the best part about doing a chargeback is that you can get back the money that you&rsquo;ve lost. For some, the amount taken can be huge, especially if you&rsquo;ve fallen for investment scams. Getting back your lost cash is a huge relief and means you don&rsquo;t have to spend years possibly trying to rebuild it.</p>\n<p><b>You&rsquo;re Sending A Message:</b><br />It might seem like all is lost if you&rsquo;ve been scammed, but the truth is, you stand a solid chance of getting your funds back. Though it might not seem too important, you&rsquo;re also sending the message that you won&rsquo;t be scammed again, not least by the same broker or individual. That means you&rsquo;re less likely to be hassled in the future.</p>\n<p><b>You Can Keep Your Reputation:</b> If your decisions mean your company is scammed, the last thing you want is to get your reputation ruined, or for rival businesses to find out what&rsquo;s happened. Getting a chargeback means you can quietly reclaim your funds without having to let everyone know what&rsquo;s gone wrong.</p>\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<p><b>There Are No Guarantees:</b> Chargebacks don&rsquo;t work every time, and yours isn&rsquo;t a guarantee either. If the scammer has already relocated your funds, it&rsquo;s very unlikely that you&rsquo;ll see them again. The faster you move, and the quicker you contact a chargeback company, the more chance you have to get your money back.</p>\n<p><b>It&rsquo;ll Cost You:</b> Depending on how much the money is that you&rsquo;ve lost, the fees for using a chargeback company might mean it&rsquo;s best to chalk this one up to a loss and learn from it. Of course, if you&rsquo;re doing your chargeback through your bank or PayPal, then the only resource you&rsquo;ll be spending is time.</p>\n<h2>How To Do A Chargeback</h2>\n<p>The process of initiating a chargeback is simple enough. Read on for the three simple steps you&rsquo;ll need to follow.</p>\n<h3>Step 1 &#8211; Reach Out:</h3>\n<p>The company or entity that originally held the funds that have been lost is where you turn to. For example, if you&rsquo;ve been hit by an advance fee scam using funds from your debit account, then turn to the bank or fintech company that issued this account. That being said, if you want to go directly through a chargeback company like Payback LTD to increase your chances of recovery, then this is also an option.</p>\n<h3>Step 2 &#8211; File Your Dispute:</h3>\n<p>When filing a dispute, be sure to give your reasoning, as well as the account, transaction, and any evidence associated with your case. The more information you give, the smoother the whole process will be, and it&rsquo;ll no doubt make the team&rsquo;s job easier that&rsquo;s working on your case.</p>\n<h3>Step 3 &#8211; Wait For The Results:</h3>\n<p>At this point, there&rsquo;s not much else you can do other than wait for the outcome. You might find that more evidence or reason is needed from the fraud team, but other than that, the best thing you can do is allow the experts to do their job.</p>\n<h3>Using Chargebacks To Recover Your Funds From Investment Scams</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b><a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/forex-scams/\">Chargebacks For The Forex Market</a>: </b>You don&rsquo;t have to have your money stolen to initiate a Forex chargeback. The quality of service and the choices a broker makes are also valid reasons. Brokers withholding your funds for personal gain is the more common example of Forex chargebacks, however.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><b><a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/binary-options-scams/\">Chargebacks For The Binary Options Market</a>: </b>Just like with Forex, binary options is a sector where scams and scam firms are incredibly common. That&rsquo;s why chargeback is so essential for this market. </li>\n<li><b><a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/cryptocurrency-scams/\">Chargebacks For The Cryptocurrency Market</a>: </b>The crypto market is relatively new, and since a lot of cryptos are always being made following the successes of Bitcoin, people of all competencies are using them. Plus, the lack of traceability with crypto means scams are rife here. Chargebacks can reclaim your funds in the event a shady platform or broker has taken them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How Payback LTD Can Help</h2>\n<p>At Payback LTD, we&rsquo;ve recovered almost one billion dollars of stolen money in just a few years. Whether our clients&rsquo; money has been taken through forex, crypto, or advance-fee scams, we&rsquo;re able to get your money back through expertise and by working as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>Our team of fraud experts will swiftly review your case, compiling all the evidence we can before confronting the entity that&rsquo;s stolen your money.

            "content": "<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has left many of us trapped indoors with nowhere to spend our disposable income. Stuck at home, people have been turning to the stock market in droves as a way to make some extra cash, hedge against inflation and even as a way to simply pass the time.</p>\n<p>\nHowever, millions of new amateur investors are at risk of more stock scams than they might realize, and the recent <a href=\"https://www.police.gov.sg/Media-Room/News/20190504_OTHERS_Police_Advisory_Pump_and_dump_scams_involving_Hong_Kong_listed_companies\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ramp and dump debacle in Hong Kong</a> serves as a timely reminder for newbies and veterans alike.</p>\n<h2>What Happened in Hong Kong?</h2>\n<p>In early March, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the local police raided a number of upmarket homes in the city, arresting 12 people accused of operating a <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/avoid-pump-and-dump-scams/\">pump and dump scheme</a>.</p>\n<p>\nThe perpetrators had been touting stocks on social media in order to draw in thousands of fresh investors, artificially raising the price of the targeted shares, which is known as the &lsquo;pump&rsquo;. The scammers then &lsquo;dumped&rsquo; the stocks, extracting profit for themselves, which crashed prices for those investors still left holding the bag.</p>\n<h2>How do Pump and Dump Scams Work?</h2>\n<p>With more of us investing in securities, we&rsquo;re seeing an increase in these types of scams. The fraudsters will often pose as legitimate companies, industry experts and even impersonate famous online influencers in order to spread their scam message. They favor social media platforms and anonymous messaging sites like Telegram and Discord to promote a chosen stock.</p>\n<p>\nThe perpetrators will then <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/avoid-pump-and-dump-scams/\">pump up a chosen stock</a>, claiming it as the next big thing, telling users they can double or triple their investments if they buy now. They&rsquo;ll coordinate hype, misinformation and rumors to get as many investors to purchase that particular stock as possible, artificially inflating the price.\n</p>\n<p>\nBrand new investors are particularly susceptible to this type of scam, and once enough unsuspecting marks have poured their money into the stock, the scammers will dump their entire holdings, making off with the profits.</p>\n<h2>What Type of Stocks are Targeted?</h2>\n<p>Fraudsters will usually target low-value stocks, or those with small market caps, as these are much more straightforward to manipulate. Plus, it&rsquo;s easier to get someone to believe that a cheap share is going to skyrocket soon, especially once they start seeing gains. These stocks generally only take a small number of investors to boost the price, meaning the perpetrators can easily coordinate buyers on social media.</p>\n<h3>How Can You Spot Pump and Dump Scams?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Being solicited directly &#8211; If you get an email or a DM on social media out of the blue from an unknown party telling you that a stock is about to explode, it&rsquo;s almost certainly a pump and dump scheme. Ignore it</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">An unexplained rise in price in the last few days &#8211; If you start to see suspicious posts on social media and message boards, go and check the price history for that stock. If there&rsquo;s been a spike in the last few days, but no prior history of growth, you&rsquo;ve almost certainly landed on a ramp and dump. Look for news articles that might explain the price rise. Has the company seen new investment? Higher sales? If all you can find is social media posts, then avoid like the plague</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Big promises of guaranteed returns &#8211; Any sensible investor will tell you there&rsquo;s no such thing as a 100% guaranteed return. Anyone promising big returns is usually a <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/most-infamous-stock-scams-of-all-time/\">red flag across all stock scams</a>, not just pump and dumps. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Stocks are pushed by unregistered brokers &#8211; Sometimes the scammers will pose as an official brokerage in order to add legitimacy, but this is all part of the scheme. Always check that your chosen broker is registered with the SEC or local financial authority before you hand over a penny</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How Can You Recover Your Money From a Stock Scam?</h2>\n<p>If you suspect you&rsquo;ve been the victim of a pump and dump scheme, it can sometimes be difficult to get your money back, especially if you don&rsquo;t know where to start the search.

            "content": "<p>The seemingly unstoppable bull run of 2021 has seen Bitcoin regularly reach staggering new highs while taking a whole clutch of other cryptocurrencies along for the ride. The price peaks have been spurred on by increasing institutional investment and the adoption by big-name investors like Elon Musk.</p>\n<p>This has brought a flood of brand new retail investors into the crypto sphere, and with it, an explosion in the number of scammers, ready to take advantage of naive new investors. Luckily, we&rsquo;re here to help and have covered the top 17 crypto scams both new and old investors need to be aware of.</p>\n<h2>1. Social Media Scams</h2>\n<p>Social media is plagued with crypto scammers. One of the most common tricks is for untrustworthy parties to spam tweets and Instagram posts with various crypto hashtags, or pretend to be popular exchanges. The posts will promise free signup bonuses or advice, but will actually contain a malware link. We&rsquo;d never recommend clicking any suspicious links or engaging with social media accounts unless you can 100% verify the identity of the poster.</p>\n<h2>2. Social Engineering Scams</h2>\n<p>More sophisticated than spam or phishing attacks, a social engineering scam will use psychological tricks to part you from your cash. Hackers will attempt to steal passwords to your cryptocurrency exchange account or pretend to be your online wallet provider in order to get you to hand over information.</p>\n<p>In a more blunt form of this scam, the perpetrator will claim to have compromising images of you taken from your webcam and will threaten to release them unless you hand over your precious Bitcoin. Don&rsquo;t fall for this, and never click on links from unknown addresses.</p>\n<h2>3. DeFi Rug Pulls</h2>\n<p>DeFi is short for &lsquo;Decentralized Finance&rsquo; and is an umbrella term for a number of cryptocurrency financial applications. The rug pull scam operates when an organization will lock in your crypto funds over an agreed time period in a smart contract, with promises of a large payout at the end.</p>\n<p>While many of these schemes are set up by legitimate actors, they tend to be riddled with vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers. When the contract ends, you can find your account has been emptied. If you want to invest in a DeFi smart contract, make sure it&rsquo;s undergone a full security and vulnerability audit and has a trusted track record.</p>\n<h2>4. Fake Bitcoin Exchanges</h2>\n<p>In most countries, you&rsquo;re required to buy your Bitcoin from a regulated exchange. Fake organizations might try to lure you in with the promise of zero fees, or the chance to buy crypto at cheaper than market rates. However, once you&rsquo;ve handed over your cash, you&rsquo;ll find the exchange has disappeared only a few months later.</p>\n<p>Always check that your chosen exchange is fully registered and regulated, and check out online reviews to confirm its validity before you sign up.</p>\n<h2>5. Fake Cryptocurrencies</h2>\n<p>Just about anyone with basic coding skills can create a brand new cryptocurrency from scratch. Scammers will often launch a new coin with promises that it&rsquo;s going to be the next big thing, or guarantee that you&rsquo;ll double your investment within a month. Some even offer the chance to win prizes if you buy a certain amount. Fraudsters will target users via email campaigns and social media posts, and once they&rsquo;ve &lsquo;sold&rsquo; enough of their coins, you&rsquo;ll never hear from them again.</p>\n<p>If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Always do your due diligence before investing and verify the names behind the project.</p>\n<h2>6. Malware</h2>\n<p>A fairly simple, but all too common Bitcoin scam. Malware is one of the oldest types of cyberattacks and it&rsquo;s adapted to exploit vulnerabilities in the crypto space. Hackers will attempt to gain access to your online wallet, scan your device for your crypto addresses and even replace the destination address for payments with their own.</p>\n<p>Make sure your device antivirus is fully up to date, never touch suspicious attachments and only download programs from legitimate platforms.</p>\n<h2>7. Imposter Websites</h2>\n<p>This is actually quite a sophisticated level of scam where imposters will mimic legitimate websites like exchanges and crypto wallet providers. Designed to look identical to the real thing, users are tricked into entering personal data and financial details.</p>\n<p>Red flags to watch out for include: pressure to deposit funds quickly, unsolicited emails with links to the fake site and excessive communication or spam. Always check the URL too in order to ensure it&rsquo;s legitimate.</p>\n<h2>8. Fake Mobile Apps</h2>\n<p>Similar to imposter sites, fake mobile apps will impersonate real exchanges in the iOS and Google Play stores. Once downloaded, these will farm your data and take payments to a fake account. Thankfully, Apple and Google are pretty good at filtering out the fakes, but if you use another app store, you might find yourself more at risk.</p>\n<p>Many of the fraudulent versions will have slightly different names to their legitimate counterparts, and again, you may find yourself pressured to make purchases if you download one.</p>\n<h2>9. Bad Tweets and Other Social Media Updates</h2>\n<p>The majority of <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/new-bitcoin-scam-in-the-making-on-twitter/\">cryptocurrency scams on Twitter</a> and other social media platforms come from fake accounts. Some might pretend to be famous influencers, while others might be pretending to be a development firm promising big returns. Most will offer links to click or websites to visit where you can invest in certain projects. We&rsquo;ll stress again, don&rsquo;t click on social media links, and don&rsquo;t trust deals that are too good to be true.</p>\n<h2>10. Scamming Emails</h2>\n<p>Email scams might just be the oldest type of cyber attack there is. They&rsquo;re usually relatively easy to spot and can include blackmail tactics, get rich quick schemes or simple messages to get you to click a ransomware link. Most email platforms these days are pretty effective at blocking out this type of mail, but if any do sneak through, we&rsquo;d recommend reporting it as spam and deleting it. Never trust any message from unsolicited sources or unknown parties.</p>\n<h2>11. Phishing</h2>\n<p>While the most popular type of phishing attacks are still via the mass email campaigns we&rsquo;ve mentioned above, there are other types of attacks to watch out for too. Spear phishing for example will attempt to build up a detailed user profile, gathering info on you such as name, address, bank details and date of birth. It&rsquo;s quite rare to see individuals targeted, but you can protect yourself by using two-factor authentication and complex passwords for all of your online accounts.</p>\n<h2>12. Fraudulent ICOs</h2>\n<p>ICO stands for &lsquo;Initial Coin Offering&rsquo; and will be used when new crypto developers are looking to raise funds to create a new coin, develop an app or launch a new service. It&rsquo;s estimated that a staggering 80% of ICOs are fake, making it incredibly difficult to find genuine ones. Scammers will usually tout their offering as the &lsquo;Next Bitcoin&rsquo; with seemingly unbelievable returns. You&rsquo;ll instead be forking over money for nothing.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re new to the world of crypto, we&rsquo;d recommend keeping your distance from ICOs. Experienced investors should do full due diligence on any project before handing over cash.</p>\n<h2>13. Bitcoin Blackmail Scams</h2>\n<p>We&rsquo;re seeing an increasing number of blackmail scams popping up as fraudsters see opportunities to capitalize on people&rsquo;s fears. Scammers will claim to have juicy personal information on you such as details of an affair you&rsquo;re having, evidence of your logins to your PayPal account or claims to have video footage of you from your webcam. The message then demands you send money to a Bitcoin address or your secrets will be revealed to your full list of contacts.</p>\n<p>In the vast majority of cases, these will be scammers simply taking a chance, sending thousands of emails and hoping one sticks. These can be safely ignored.</p>\n<h2>14. Impersonation Giveaway Scams</h2>\n<p>The most common impersonation scam will be someone setting up a fake social media account of somebody famous, which will then tweet or post with offers of an investment opportunity. Others will promise bounty rewards or airdrops of Bitcoin for the first sign-ups. However, each link only leads to a fraudster&rsquo;s account.</p>\n<p>Platforms themselves can also be subject to attack, as seen back in July 2020 when a number of high-profile Twitter accounts were compromised. Hackers used the official accounts of Barack Obama, Bill Gates and Apple among others to scam users out of more than $100,000 worth of Bitcoin. Never click on any links, and don&rsquo;t trust anything that&rsquo;s too good to be true.</p>\n<h2>15. Ponzi or Pyramid Schemes</h2>\n<p>Ponzi schemes (or <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/identify-and-avoid-pyramid-schemes/\">pyramid schemes</a>) are related to the fraudulent ICOs we mentioned earlier, but work a little differently in that early investors will actually see some initial payouts. Investors will be asked to stump up large sums of cash to purchase a brand new coin and will be rewarded with money brought in by new investors a few weeks or months later.</p>\n<p>The initial participants (having seen some good returns) will now be convinced the project is a success and will encourage others to join, as well as putting more of their own money into the scheme. Eventually, the scammers shut it down and make off with the profits. These are pretty easy to spot and you should avoid any new offering that pressures you to recruit fresh investors.</p>\n<h2>16. Mining Scams</h2>\n<p>Bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies are &lsquo;mined&rsquo; via the solving of complex mathematical equations. Individual users can contribute to this process by signing up for a cloud mining service, lending the computing power of their device to the mining operation. Once equipment and electricity costs are taken into account, though, your profits will generally be quite small these days and it&rsquo;s just not worth it for most.</p>\n<p>However, scammers have now stepped in to take advantage of naive investors that don&rsquo;t know the pitfalls of crypto mining, promising huge returns. These are often just fronts to steal data or will come with multiple hidden fees. If you&rsquo;re new to crypto, we&rsquo;d recommend staying away from any sort of mining activity altogether.</p>\n<h2>17. Pumps and Dumps</h2>\n<p>As we&rsquo;re still in the early days of crypto development and investment, many coins share characteristics with speculative investments, leaving them open to market manipulation. A pump and dump scheme involves a group of coordinated buyers purchasing a particular coin in large quantities, usually smaller altcoins with very small market caps in order to hike the price up.</p>\n<p>The scammers will then promote the coin across social media, driving many newbies to invest in the hopes of getting rich quickly. Once the price has been sufficiently inflated, the organizers will dump their entire holding and cash out. This then crashes the price for those that invested late, leaving them with worthless coins.</p>\n<p>Keep your eye out for low-market-cap coins that experience a sudden jump in price, and be very wary of social media accounts promoting such products.</p>\n<h2>How Can You Get Your Money Back After a Cryptocurrency Scam?</h2>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve lost money to a crypto scam, don&rsquo;t lose hope. While it might feel like the industry is a little like the Wild West, there are multiple ways to recover your investment.

            "content": "<h2>What Is a Military Romance Scam?</h2>\n<p>With the rise of <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/scams-on-dating-sites-are-real-2021-guide/\">dating websites</a>, apps and social media platforms, those looking for true love have more options than ever before to find their perfect partner. However, the online world can be plagued with scammers, waiting to take advantage of vulnerable lonely hearts and con as much money as possible from their targets.</p>\n<p>The military romance scam remains one of the most common types of online frauds, with the US Army Criminal Investigation Command (CID) claiming they receive hundreds of calls each day from people reporting fake profiles, and from victims that have been swindled out of their cash.</p>\n<p>The scammers will pretend to be members of the US military online, slowly gaining the target&rsquo;s trust over time, before using various methods to extract funds from them. Many victims can find themselves thousands of dollars out of pocket, and in extreme cases, up to <a href=\"https://www.aarp.org/money/scams-fraud/info-2019/military-online-dating.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$450,000 was lost</a> by one innocent party alone.</p>\n<h3>How do Military Romance Scams Work</h3>\n<p>Fraudsters will search social media profiles and official US military websites for images of genuine soldiers. They&rsquo;ll then download and steal these photographs and use them to set up fake profiles across dating sites, social media platforms and messaging apps.</p>\n<p>They&rsquo;ll then start searching for vulnerable victims, often targeting widows and older women, or those who might be more susceptible to their advances. You might be surprised to learn that most army romance scams are carried out on Facebook, where perpetrators will test the waters by targeting groups.</p>\n<p>The vast majority of those targeted are women aged from the late 30s to late 70s that are living in the US, although the scammers have been known to hook victims from across the globe.</p>\n<p>Once drawn in, the fraudsters play on the target&rsquo;s loneliness, slowly building up a relationship over time before starting to request transfers of funds. The scammers aren&rsquo;t just limited to military love scams either, in a particular insidious twist, they&rsquo;ll also target grieving widows or parents that have lost relatives on active service. They hope to prey on a victim&rsquo;s genuine desire to help out a member of the armed forces that might need assistance.</p>\n<h2>Where do Military Romance Scammers Come From?</h2>\n<p>The majority of military romance scams originate from West Africa, particularly Nigeria. The perpetrators tend to be young men that have been attracted to criminal life because the rewards are far higher than taking an honest job. This type of fraud is rife in the country, with an estimated 50% of all global email frauds emanating from here.</p>\n<p>While the Nigerian government is attempting to crack down on these operations, they can be difficult to track, and many scammers face no consequences if they get found out by their victims.</p>\n<p>Nigeria is one of the best-connected countries in West Africa and has a huge telecoms industry, with more than 100 million citizens now online. This prevalence of internet access, coupled with fluency in English, means these scams are incredibly easy to set up and are often operated by large criminal groups, sending hundreds, if not thousands of messages each day.</p>\n<h2>What Are the Most Common Platforms for Military Romance Scams</h2>\n<h3>Military Scams on Dating Sites</h3>\n<p>While not as common as Facebook scams, dating sites remain a popular target for fraudsters. Generally, the fake profile will claim to be either stationed overseas or to be living in another part of the country, making it difficult to meet up in person. They&rsquo;ll tend to profess their love for the victim fairly early on into the relationship, and phrases like &lsquo;My love&rsquo; or &lsquo;My darling&rsquo; tend to be early red flags that something is amiss.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/scams-on-dating-sites-are-real-2021-guide/\">Dating site scams</a> tend to be a longer con than on social media, as the perpetrator will slowly build up the relationship, teasing an eventual meeting several months down the line. This gives them plenty of time to start with small requests for cash, for example, they may claim that they need money for new boots or equipment, and this eventually builds up to larger requests such as cash for an emergency situation.</p>\n<p>One common request is money for airline tickets, when the scammer claims they&rsquo;d like to visit the victim in person, but will say they don&rsquo;t have the money for it. If the scammer is claiming to be stationed overseas, this could mean they&rsquo;re potentially asking for thousands of dollars for a plane ticket, but of course, they&rsquo;ll never show up.</p>\n<h3>Social Media</h3>\n<p>Military romance scams are far more prevalent on social media, particularly on Facebook. They work slightly differently to dating website frauds, and usually start with fairly innocuous comments on your posts. The perpetrators will usually target military groups and pages in order to narrow down their list of victims. Comments and likes will be a way of testing the water to see how receptive you are to the advances of a stranger.</p>\n<p>The scammers will usually work from scripts, and have responses for a variety of situations that might come up, including lists of hobbies and interests, with each one designed to push you into the next stage before finally asking for money transfers. They&rsquo;ll often try to take the conversation away from Facebook and onto messaging apps to do this.</p>\n<h2>How Can You Recognize a Military Romance Scam?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Very few comments or followers &#8211; If the social media account you&rsquo;re interacting with doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of activity, then it&rsquo;s a good sign it&rsquo;s a fake. If you&rsquo;re suspicious, ask them to send an email from their official US military account, each genuine one should end with &lsquo;.mil&rsquo;&nbsp;</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Don&rsquo;t trust requests for cash &#8211; The military will cover all medical and equipment costs for active service members, and those on leave will still be paid a salary. Any request for cash should be a major red flag and not to be trusted</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fast escalation of the relationship &#8211; If someone moves the relationship on quickly, professes their love early or is generally pushy, this is often a sign of a scam</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Duplicate profiles &#8211; scammers will often steal the real name of a soldier as well as their photos. A quick search of social media will reveal if there are any duplicate profiles</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ask questions &#8211; If you&rsquo;re suspicious, ask lots of detailed questions, and use Google reverse image search to verify photos. Simple interrogation of the scammer is usually enough to put them off</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve fallen victim to a military dating scam, don&rsquo;t worry, there may be a way to get your money back.

            "content": "<h2>The History of Nigerian Facebook Scams</h2>\n<p>The Nigerian Facebook scams we see today have their origins back in the early days of the internet during the 1990s, when scammers would send thousands of spam emails asking for cash. We&rsquo;re all familiar with the old <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/nigerian-prince-scam-still-fooling-people-2021/\">Nigerian Prince scheme</a>, in which fraudsters would email victims pretending to be a rich Nigerian, promising vast sums of cash for anyone that handed over their financial details.</p>\n<p>Operations have become a little more sophisticated since then, and have evolved into a range of Nigerian Facebook scams. These crimes are known as <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes/nigerian-letter-or-419-fraud\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">419 frauds</a>, named after the Nigerian penal code section that deals with such offenses. It&rsquo;s estimated that more than 50% of these types of scams the world over now originate in the country.</p>\n<h2>How do Nigerian Scammers on Facebook Operate?</h2>\n<p>The scammers still utilize some of the spam tactics of the old days, often sending out thousands of messages per day in order to ensnare their victims. Those most often targeted these days tend to be vulnerable groups such as lonely hearts looking for romance and people that have lost loved ones, or appealing to people&rsquo;s greed by promising free money.</p>\n<p>Nigerian scammers on Facebook will even stoop to impersonating trusted friends and loved ones from your contact list in an effort to increase the chances of success. Fraudsters will try to work their way into your trust, commenting on posts, building a relationship, and attempting to connect with mutual friends to add legitimacy.</p>\n<p>Nigerian citizens are well connected, and its growing telecoms industry now has more than 100 million people online. Coupled with fluency in English, it&rsquo;s incredibly easy for a group of criminals to set up a Facebook scamming operation. As soon as the government cracks down on one, two more pop up to take its place.</p>\n<h2>Common Nigerian Scams on Facebook</h2>\n<h3>Nigerian Military Scams</h3>\n<p>Nigerian military scams are one of the most common types of fraud on Facebook. Here, perpetrators will steal photographs of genuine members of the US military, using them to set up a fake profile. They&rsquo;ll then trawl groups and profiles looking for anyone with a connection to the armed forces, or those looking for love, before sending a message or commenting on posts.</p>\n<p>After building up a level of trust with the victim, the fraudster will then start to make requests for money to be sent via wire transfer. These will usually start small so as not to arouse suspicion, and will be for items like new pieces of equipment or a credit card for off-base expenses.</p>\n<p>The scam slowly builds until larger and larger sums are requested, purported to be for medical bills or travel costs, but of course, it&rsquo;s all a sham. Typical targets will be lonely women in their late 30s to late 70s.</p>\n<h3>Nigerian Romance Scams</h3>\n<p>Romance scams often go hand in hand with the aforementioned military scam but cover a much broader target market. Scammers will leave comments, or message Facebook users out of the blue, honing in on those with single relationship status. The scam has elements of a honey trap, as beautiful women will pretend to be attracted to young men, claiming they want a relationship.</p>\n<p>Many use fake or stolen pictures and will send hundreds of friend requests per day in the hopes that users are drawn in by a pretty face. Then, once accepted, the fraudsters will use the same sort of begging tactics of other scams, claiming they need funds transferred for various expenses, always dangling the chance of a meeting to keep victims interested.</p>\n<h3>Inheritance Scams</h3>\n<p>An evolved form of the old email scam, the classic inheritance scam is still with us, and people are still falling victim to it. In this Nigerian Facebook scam, elderly and lonely victims are often the intended targets and will be sent messages claiming to be holding on to an inheritance. All the victim needs to do is send a &lsquo;verification payment&rsquo; and the full funds will be released.</p>\n<p>Scammers are getting a little more sophisticated these days and are setting up fake profiles of family members of the intended victim in order to extract funds. Elderly Facebook users might be less likely to be suspicious if they see a message from a supposed family member claiming they have an inheritance due, and may not do any digging.</p>\n<h3>The Friend In Need Scam</h3>\n<p>This is one of the newer Nigerian scams on FB and involves the perpetrator setting up a dummy account from a victim&rsquo;s friends list. This includes copying pictures and posts to make them look legitimate. The scammer then emails their &lsquo;friend&rsquo; claiming they&rsquo;ve got in some financial hot water and need bailing out.</p>\n</p>\n<p>The fraudsters work to script and often look for people on vacation, with a common claim being they were robbed in a foreign country and need their friend to bail them out. The best way to deal with this type of scam is to make your account completely private.</p>\n<h3>Blackmail Scams</h3>\n<p>In a step up from the romance scam, malicious parties are now drawing victims into compromising situations via Facebook. While users think they might have found a new long distance love interest via Facebook, they&rsquo;ll instead be tricked into adult video messaging chats that will be recorded by the scammer.</p>\n<p>The victim will then be threatened with exposure to their friends and family unless they pay up. This particularly vicious scam has seen a sharp rise in recent years and is definitely one to watch out for.</p>\n<h2>How Can You Protect Yourself From Facebook Scams from Nigeria?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Never send money to those you haven&rsquo;t met in person &#8211; While this seems like obvious advice, you&rsquo;d be surprised at just how manipulative scammers can be and how often people will do this</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Change your privacy settings &#8211; Make sure your Facebook account is completely private, and is set up to block anyone outside of your friend group from commenting or messaging</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Watch out for spelling and grammar issues &#8211; These are usually a sure sign something is wrong, and you should be especially suspicious of poor spelling on accounts that claim to be from people you know</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Someone wants to take the conversation off Facebook &#8211; This is another major red flag. Never contact someone outside of the platform unless you&rsquo;re 100% sure of their identity</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">Never accept friend requests from people you don&rsquo;t know &#8211; This is probably the most sensible advice to stay safe. If the scammers can&rsquo;t contact you, they can&rsquo;t con you</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, no matter how many measures you take to protect yourself, there&rsquo;s always a chance you&rsquo;ll fall victim to a Nigerian Facebook scam. It&rsquo;s certainly possible to get your money back and, at <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/contact-us/\">PayBack</a>, our experts have years of experience in hunting down perpetrators and recovering funds that have been lost to fraud.

            "content": "<p>To a large extent, the Nigerian prince scam has become a victim of its own success. It&rsquo;s now seen as a joke and is widely recognized for what it is &#8211; an outdated con that was used by fraudsters in the early days of email and the internet. Surely nobody these days would fall for such an obvious scam, would they?</p>\n<p>It might surprise you to learn that as <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/18/nigerian-prince-scams-still-rake-in-over-700000-dollars-a-year.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">recently as 2018</a>, the Nigerian prince scam was estimated to have raked in over $700,000 &#8211; and that figure was just from unsuspecting Americans. Even today, there are people who still believe the story of the generous prince who promises to share his untold millions with you, if only you&rsquo;ll send him a small advance, or your bank account details.</p>\n<p>Perhaps surprisingly, the Nigerian prince email scam is still as relevant as it ever was. In its original form, it still has enough appeal to take in unsuspecting victims. But more importantly, it serves as a reminder that the <a href=\"https://www.bbb.org/scamtracker/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">scammers haven&rsquo;t gone away</a> &#8211; they&rsquo;ve merely refined their methods, changed their tactics, and moved on to additional platforms.</p>\n<p>So read on for a brief history of Nigerian prince scams, the most common tactics, and advice on how you can protect yourself from this and similar internet frauds.</p>\n<h2>How did the Nigerian prince scam start?</h2>\n<p>Would you believe that the Nigerian prince scam dates back hundreds of years? At the time of the French Revolution (the end of the 18th century), handwritten letters were sent out, begging for money to help release a nobleman languishing in a Spanish jail. In return, the grateful nobleman would repay you lavishly for your help in securing his freedom. But, of course, there was no nobleman, and any funds forwarded simply disappeared.</p>\n<p>The so-called &ldquo;Spanish Prisoner&rdquo; con was an early example of an advance-fee scam, where a huge sum was promised in return for a relatively small upfront investment. Then, as now, the story appealed to our human nature &#8211; risky, yes, but with just enough credibility that it could be true, mixed in with the romantic ideal of helping a noble person who&rsquo;d fallen on hard times, and above all, the chance of untold riches!</p>\n<p>So the basic scam has been with us for many years, although the Nigerian prince has long since replaced the Spanish Prisoner. But some things never change. Once the fall-guy has sent the money, the scammer either disappears or says that they&rsquo;ll need just a little more cash in order to release the funds&hellip; which, naturally, never happens.</p>\n<p>Moving swiftly forward to the 1980s, people began to receive international scamming letters through the post. Such letters were often sent using counterfeit stamps. Then in the 1990s, we saw the rise of email and the internet, which suddenly made communication a whole lot easier and cheaper. And that&rsquo;s when the Nigerian prince email scam really started to take off.</p>\n<p>In response to the growing number of advance-fee and money laundering schemes originating there, the Nigerian government established the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) in 2003. The creation of this law enforcement agency underlined the fact that many of these crimes were centered in Nigeria. However, it&rsquo;s important to remember that many similar style scams originate from other countries.</p>\n<h2>How to recognize a Nigerian prince scammer?</h2>\n<p>If you have an email address, then at some stage in your life you&rsquo;ve probably received a Nigerian prince email. In many respects, email is the perfect format for a Nigerian prince scammer. It&rsquo;s relatively cheap, easy, and convenient to send out a spam email, and scammers only need a few respondents to make everything worthwhile.</p>\n<p>But the Prince of Nigeria scam isn&rsquo;t just about email. Other electronic forms of communication like SMS and fax machines are also just as convenient for crooks. And that&rsquo;s before we even mention popular social media platforms like <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/what-is-a-nigerian-facebook-scam-and-how-you-can-avoid-it/\">Facebook</a>, Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter. All of these platforms make it relatively simple for one person to contact huge numbers of potential victims.</p>\n<p>By now, most of us are wise to the tactics used by Nigerian prince scammers and can see them coming a mile off. Here&rsquo;s a list of some of the more obvious red flags:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">The original email, tweet, SMS, or contact is unsolicited&nbsp;</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">The sender has a royal title or claims to be a foreign dignitary. More recently, this has evolved to include Middle Eastern bankers, US soldiers fighting overseas, lottery winners, rich orphans, and sons of Russian Oligarchs&nbsp;</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">The scam is usually linked to a country or region where there&rsquo;s corruption, confusion &#8211; and plenty of money!&nbsp;</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">The sender says they&rsquo;ll share a huge amount of money with you, but only after you&rsquo;ve sent them funds or your bank details</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Key characteristics of the Nigerian prince email</h2>\n<p>Although we might laugh at the idea of the Nigerian prince scams, in essence, they&rsquo;re no different from all the other forms of internet fraud, from a &ldquo;double your Bitcoin&rdquo; swindle to a fake, money-grabbing online date. In every case, the aim of the scammers is the same: to cheat you out of your hard-earned cash.</p>\n<p>Because the Nigerian prince email scam has been around for so long, it&rsquo;s a relatively simple matter to identify the key characteristics and form of the content. If you receive an email containing any of the features below, the alarm bells in your head should start ringing immediately!</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>An emotional appeal to your better nature</b>: this may take the form of a seemingly small request for help, and is often designed to tug at your heartstrings. The language used may be personal and emotionally-charged</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>A small initial request</b>: the scammer may ask an apparently innocent and innocuous question in order to establish contact with you. Only later on will the true motive appear</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Poor English and grammatical errors</b>: this may appear obvious after the event, but ask yourself this question: if someone was a prominent member of a royal family or a top international banker, wouldn&rsquo;t they be able to spell correctly?</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>The promise of unreal returns</b>: whilst some of the content may be designed to engage with your higher nature, there&rsquo;s also an appeal to your baser instincts &#8211; namely, the chance to make big money for a small investment</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>A request for personal information</b>: you can only help the person &#8211; and secure your returns &#8211; if you share private information, like your bank details</li>\n<li><b>Increasing demands</b>: once you&rsquo;ve been hooked, you may find yourself facing additional requests for more and more funds</li>\n<li><b>The trail suddenly goes cold</b>: this is typically accompanied by unusual activity in your bank account, alongside the sickening realization that you&rsquo;ve been conned</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How to protect yourself from Nigerian prince scams?</h2>\n<p>With a little common sense, it&rsquo;s not too difficult to reduce the risk of being scammed. Don&rsquo;t trust emails or communications from people you don&rsquo;t know. If you&rsquo;re tempted to reply, before you do, seek a second opinion from someone you respect.</p>\n<p>Learn the obvious warning signs that come with internet scams. Never, ever give your bank details to strangers. Look for the truth behind the hype. Make sure your computer security is up to date (this will often prevent fraudulent spam from getting anywhere near your inbox). And above all, remember that if something looks too good to be true, it usually is.</p>\n<p>Many people who&rsquo;ve been victims of internet scams let things lie, either because they believe that their money must be gone forever, or because they&rsquo;re too ashamed to admit that they fell for such an obvious hoax.</p>\n<p>This is where Payback comes in.

            "content": "<p>Instagram and Bitcoin have some stuff in common. Both are relative newcomers to the digital space, and both have experienced unprecedented growth in recent times. Instagram started life in 2010 as a simple mobile app for sharing photos and videos, but it&rsquo;s grown to become much more than that. It&rsquo;s now one of the most popular social media platforms, with over a billion people using Instagram every month</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin has grown from nothing to become the world&rsquo;s most important digital currency. As of early 2021, it&rsquo;s estimated to have a market capitalization of over $600 billion.</p>\n<p>The phenomenal rise of these two digital platforms has attracted huge numbers of subscribers and investors &#8211; and regrettably, huge numbers of scammers too. So here&rsquo;s the dangerous truth in 2022 about Instagram Bitcoin scams.</p>\n<h2>How did dating site scams originate?</h2>\n<p>Users of Instagram tend to be young, tech-savvy, and fashionable, with over 60% of the demographic falling between the ages of 18 and 34. Fans of Instagram love it because it&rsquo;s so up-to-the-minute, full of cool celebrities and on-trend influencers, plus it&rsquo;s easy to shop there.</p>\n<p>But the same things that make Instagram so appealing to subscribers also make it attractive to scammers. In the fast-moving world of Instagram, it&rsquo;s all too easy to be taken in by bogus get-rich-quick schemes, fake profiles or celebrity endorsements, fantastic giveaways that are anything but, and fake luxury goods at unbelievable prices. Often the scammers take advantage of the young age and relative inexperience of Instagrammers. Moreover, the platform&rsquo;s popularity also gives crooks the opportunity to reach a wide audience with ease.</p>\n<p>Many scams on Instagram involve the best-known cryptocurrency Bitcoin. The secretive, unregulated nature of Bitcoin lends itself to fraud: once the transaction is done, it&rsquo;s notoriously difficult &#8211; or even impossible &#8211; to track where your money has gone. And because cryptocurrencies are still a relatively new area, many people have little experience of how they work, making them even more susceptible to scammers.</p>\n<p>The frauds are as creative and varied as Instagram itself. Bitcoin scams on Instagram come in <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-instagram-becoming-thing-scams-083135001.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">all shapes and sizes</a>, from fraudulent bitcoin mining schemes to phishing, from counterfeit or non-existent goods to Ponzi pyramid schemes, from blackmail to wallet thefts. And as Bitcoin grows in popularity, so do the scams. Reports state that cryptocurrency-related crimes added up to a staggering $2.6 billion in 2020, albeit that figure is down on 2019&rsquo;s record number.</p>\n<p>So what can you do to make sure you don&rsquo;t fall for an Instagram Bitcoin scam? The younger generation might not care to admit it, but all the old cliches apply. Prevention is better than cure. Let the buyer beware. And the old favorite: if something looks too good to be true, it probably is.</p>\n<p>Above and beyond the trusted, old-fashioned advice, there are also a number of simple steps you can take to stay safe. Often, there are common warning signs, plus if you&rsquo;re aware of what form the scams take, it can help you to avoid them. And even if you do get scammed, there may still be a way to get your Bitcoins back. Read on to learn more.</p>\n<h2>How can you tell a Bitcoin scammer on Instagram?</h2>\n<p>If it was easy to spot a Bitcoin scammer on Instagram, then no-one would ever get ripped off. The sad fact is that many scammers are brilliant at what they do, devising sophisticated and highly convincing frauds. That said, once you know what to look for, it becomes easier to differentiate between genuine and rogue operators.</p>\n<p>Online scammers use a range of techniques and tactics to try and ensnare their victims. Many of these methods apply to all social media platforms, not just Instagram. So here&rsquo;s some advice on how to identify Bitcoin scam Instagram fraudsters, and what you can do to avoid being taken in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Don&rsquo;t fall for the hype</b>: Often scammers will make inflated promises or offer unreal returns. Be especially wary of contacts who pressurize you with short-term offers saying that you&rsquo;ll miss out unless you sign up there and then. In cases like this, you&rsquo;ll often see a rogue login link &#8211; so don&rsquo;t be tempted!</li>\n<li><b>Look beyond the flashy images</b>: An Instagram post, a company profile, or a website may look sleek and sophisticated, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&#8217;s genuine. Watch out for cloned profiles and <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/12-easy-ways-to-check-if-a-website-is-legit-or-a-scam/\">scam websites</a> that look like the real thing.</li>\n<li><b>Take a step back</b>: ask yourself why a celebrity would back a Bitcoin scheme. There&rsquo;s a long history of fake celebrity endorsements on all social media channels, including Instagram.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><b>Watch out for bad grammar or poor spelling</b>: Genuine companies will take the time to get this right, whereas scammers often fail to look after the small details. Often once you spot one minor mistake, other warning signs will become readily apparent.</li>\n<li><b>Take care what you share</b>: Be on your guard with any companies who ask you for personal or private information upfront. Never share any of your financial details unless you are 100% certain that the company is genuine.</li>\n<li><b>Be cynical</b>: if a stranger starts following you, ask yourself why.</li>\n<li><b>Trust your intuition</b>: If something doesn&rsquo;t feel right, it generally isn&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t be wise after the event: the world is full of people who let their heads rule over their hearts!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Common Bitcoin scams on Instagram:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/5-common-instagram-scams-to-be-aware-of-in-2021/\">Common Instagram scams</a> take many forms. Here are some of the more common scams involving Bitcoin on Instagram:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/6-common-phishing-scams-you-need-to-know-in-2021/\"><b>Phishing</b></a>: there are plenty of Instagram scammers out there trying to collect (or phish for) your personal information, such as codes, passwords, or login details. Common tactics include impersonating the Bitcoin brand, or offering supposedly useful services once you&rsquo;ve entered your details. Remember, never, ever share your private Bitcoin key.</li>\n<li><b>Fake exchanges</b>: watch out for fake exchanges that buy and sell cryptocurrencies. Some actually appear to trade legitimately for a while before vanishing. It&rsquo;s an obvious thing to say but only work with trusted, genuine exchanges.</li>\n<li><b>Mining scams</b>: Bitcoin mining scams on Instagram are a popular form of fraud. People are taken in by the chance to come together and use their collective power to &ldquo;mine&rdquo; for and be rewarded, with new Bitcoins. In reality, many of the companies offering this service are simply a front to take your money from you.</li>\n<li><b>Flipping</b>: with flipping, companies promise to flip your investment right back to you with amazing returns. So they&rsquo;ll exchange your Bitcoins at a great rate once you&rsquo;ve paid a joining fee, or they&rsquo;ll return them almost instantly with amazing interest. Except, of course, they simply disappear once you&rsquo;ve sent them your money.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/identify-and-avoid-pyramid-schemes/\"><b>Pyramid schemes</b></a>: Remember Bernie Madoff and his Ponzi scheme, with fantastic returns until the pyramid comes crashing down? Well, Instagram has been home to many similar frauds. You have been warned!</li>\n<li><b>Digital wallet thefts</b>: a digital wallet is where you hold cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Many wallet operators are genuine, but some aren&rsquo;t &#8211; so be careful where you keep your Bitcoins and don&rsquo;t share your private key.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What happens if you fall victim to an Instagram Bitcoin scam?</h2>\n<p>One of the advantages of using payment forms like PayPal or a credit card is that you may have some form of a comeback if you&rsquo;re ripped off. But that&rsquo;s not the case with cryptocurrencies: if you&rsquo;ve fallen victim to an Instagram Bitcoin scam, that&rsquo;s it &#8211; your money&rsquo;s gone forever.</p>\n<p>Or is it? It might surprise you to learn that in certain cases, you may actually be able to get your money back. Regulators across the world have woken up to what&rsquo;s happening in the crypto space, and are starting to get their act together. But perhaps more significantly, a number of dedicated funds recovery companies &#8211; such as Payback &#8211; have developed the relevant skills and tools to go after scammers and get back monies that have been taken fraudulently.</p>\n<p>Here at Payback, we&rsquo;ve been helping victims of online fraud since 2008, and we&rsquo;ve brought all our experience and knowledge together to help victims of Bitcoin Instagram scams.

            "content": "<p>We&rsquo;ve all heard of well-known online scams involving cryptocurrencies or the notorious Nigerian prince email. But the average losses from these two frauds are nothing when compared to dating site scams. Amazingly, on average, only fake investment schemes are more costly to victims. A report from the <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/data-spotlight/2021/02/romance-scams-take-record-dollars-2020\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Trade Commission</a> shared that in 2020 over $300 million (a 50% increase from 2019) in losses from online dating scams!</p>\n<p>However, it&rsquo;s important to remember that not all dating sites are scams, and also that many people have found true and lasting love thanks to the internet. So to help you stay on the right side of the tracks, take advantage of our Must-Read 2022 Guide about online dating scams. We&rsquo;ll tell you about the most popular scams, how to protect yourself, the added dangers of mobile dating apps, and potential comebacks if you&rsquo;re unfortunate enough to get scammed.</p>\n<h2>How did dating site scams originate?</h2>\n<p>As long as people have been dating face to face, there have been scammers and cheats. And as long as there have been online dating sites, there have also been dating site scammers and cheats. In that respect, scammers on dating websites are nothing new.</p>\n<p>The internet and mobile apps make it super easy for us to scan, filter and contact potential partners on dating sites. But the downside to all that convenience is that it also makes it super easy for scammers to scan, filter and contact potential victims.</p>\n<p>You may have heard of the term &ldquo;catfish&rdquo; in relation to dating scams. The word is used to describe someone who uses a fake personality to trick a person into a sham relationship. In America, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catfish:_The_TV_Show\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Catfish: The TV Show</a>&rdquo; has become a popular program about the truth and lies surrounding online dating.</p>\n<p>Sometimes with dating sites scams, there&rsquo;s no financial angle. People fake relationships for their own kicks, or to teach someone they know a lesson, or simply for no-strings-attached affairs. But the fact remains that many scams are centered around money. That may take the form of a simple but bogus request for financial help, but in more sinister cases, it may result in blackmail or extortion, in return for keeping silent about the affair, or not revealing compromising messages and pictures.</p>\n<h2>Some of the most well-known dating website scams</h2>\n<p>A quick Google search reveals the all too real and costly dangers of online dating. A woman in Aurora, CO, lost $250,000, her house and her life savings to a conman she met on a dating site. An 80-year-old man in Florida handed over $200,000 to a scammer who&rsquo;d stolen a woman&rsquo;s identity. And in Ireland, the Garda (police) website tells the story of a woman who received expensive gifts from her suitor, before losing &euro;48,000 which she invested in his sham company.</p>\n<p>In every case, the people involved fell for the phony charms of an utterly convincing, smooth-talking suitor. You can be sure that the dating site scams list is far, far longer than the three examples described above, but many victims are simply too scared, ashamed, or embarrassed to come forward.</p>\n<p>And there&rsquo;s actually another unsavory aspect to online dating. In 2019, the US Federal Trade Commission <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2019/09/ftc-sues-owner-online-dating-service-matchcom-using-fake-love\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">launched a lawsuit</a> against some of the most well-known dating sites, alleging that they created false profiles in order to lure customers in. This lawsuit reminds us that if you&rsquo;re paying a fee to register, you should always check the credibility of the site, read the small print, and be sure of what you&rsquo;re signing up for.</p>\n<h2>Tips to recognize scammers on dating sites</h2>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re new to the scene, you may not know how to spot online dating scams. But there are certain warning signs to watch out for. Here are some of the more common tactics used by scammers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">They have an extremely attractive profile picture (which may not be their own!).</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">They hurry the relationship along and quickly suggest moving communications away from the dating website and on to texts, phone calls, or messaging apps.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">They ask you lots of personal questions, but they consciously avoid giving you any detailed information about themselves.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">They use words to flatter you and build you up, make you feel attractive, and give you a special pet name.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Once the relationship&rsquo;s established, they start asking you for financial help, often for small amounts at first, before building up to larger sums. Or they may tell you a sob story about money worries, in the hope that you&rsquo;ll offer to help.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">They avoid Skype and other video calls, and never meet you in person. Any arrangements to do so are always canceled at the last moment or never come to fruition.</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">They claim to be living abroad, which is why they can&rsquo;t meet up or why they need money to pay for their fare to come and see you. You may not be surprised to learn that international dating scams are actually one of the most common frauds on dating sites.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>A quick warning on dating app scams</h2>\n<p>Although the more established dating services like match.com started life as websites, many people now use mobile apps like Tinder, Grindr, or Bumble for dating. So what&rsquo;s the difference between these apps and more traditional dating websites &#8211; and are there any additional risks that apply to apps?</p>\n<p>The first point to make is that all the same warnings that apply to dating websites apply to dating apps. You still need to exercise caution and take care of what information you share.</p>\n<p>That said, there are certain aspects of mobile dating apps that potentially make them riskier.</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">First up is the issue of immediacy. We carry our mobile phones with us at all times, which means we may be tempted to respond to a message immediately, rather than taking the time to weigh up the consequences.&nbsp;</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Next, mobile apps may use GPS, making the location of one or both parties clear. Such information could potentially be used for stalking, for example.&nbsp;</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">And finally, there&rsquo;s the simple reality that the sheer popularity of apps over dating websites makes them more attractive to scammers because it gives them a greater target market.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Although the more established dating services like match.com started life as websites, many people now use mobile apps like Tinder, Grindr, or Bumble for dating. So what&rsquo;s the difference between these apps and more traditional dating websites &#8211; and are there any additional risks that apply to apps?</p>\n<h2>How can you protect yourself from scams on dating sites?</h2>\n<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to be taken in when someone takes a romantic interest in us. It&rsquo;s a great boost to the ego, particularly for people who&rsquo;ve lost a loved one, who are lonely, or who&rsquo;ve been single for a while. Just remember, however, that scammers often cynically select their victims based on people in those very situations.</p>\n<p>You can help to keep yourself safe by heeding the following advice. First, only use trusted dating websites or apps: take time to research the best scam-free dating sites. Check to see if the person has a presence on other social media platforms, and be wary if they don&rsquo;t, or if they have a fake-looking profile. Use Google&rsquo;s image search feature to see if the person&rsquo;s picture is being used elsewhere. And be extremely careful about sharing any personal information, especially any financial details or intimate pictures.</p>\n<p>In that first flush of interest, it can be difficult to trust your instincts, especially because the other person could really be genuine. But always remember at the back of your mind that they might be stringing you along.</p>\n<p>Many people who&rsquo;ve lost money to a dating app or dating site scam simply write off their losses, because they believe it&rsquo;s impossible to get their money back, or because they&rsquo;re too embarrassed by what happened. At Payback, however, we take a different view. We&rsquo;re great believers in justice and fairness, and we don&rsquo;t think scammers on dating websites should be able to get away with their criminal actions.</p>\n<p>To that end, we offer a discrete, confidential, and highly effective <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/\">funds recovery service</a> for people who&rsquo;ve been ripped off by scammers on dating sites. Why not <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/contact-us/\">give us a call right now</a> to discuss how we might be able to help you? You may be able to recover money that you thought was gone forever.</p>\n",

            "content": "<p>Back In July 2020, Twitter was hit by a Bitcoin scam. Scammers hacked into a number of high-profile accounts and sent out a Tweet asking Bitcoin investors to lodge money to a specific cryptocurrency account. In return, twice the amount would be sent back to them, as a &ldquo;charitable gesture.&rdquo; Because the Tweet appeared to come from a reputable source, a number of people were duped, before Twitter blocked or temporarily closed the affected accounts.</p>\n<p>The above story demonstrates two things. First, it&rsquo;s proof of the skill, ingenuity, and deviousness of scammers (in this case, it&rsquo;s thought they may have used Twitter insiders to help them). And second, it shows that there are still intelligent people out there who are taken in by the promise of &ldquo;get-rich-quick&rdquo; schemes.</p>\n<p>All of which leads us to February 2021, and the latest Bitcoin scam on Twitter. Once again, this latest fraud showcased the creative ability and criminal intent of scammers. Once again, it showed just how vulnerable all social media platforms &#8211; and not just Twitter &#8211; are to cyber-attacks. And once again, it proved that users across all platforms need to stay alert and be aware of the dangers of online scams.</p>\n<p>For some reason, there has been little mainstream coverage of the February 2021 scam. So read on for a thought-provoking tale involving Bitcoin scammers, Twitter, a Korean pop band, their famous global army of fans &hellip; and the unexpected resilience of the next generation.</p>\n<h2>BTS, K-POP and the ARMY: How the Scam Unfolded</h2>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s get the acronyms out of the way first: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BTS\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BTS</a> is a world-famous Korean pop (K-POP) band whose millions of enthusiastic fans are known as the ARMY (Adorable Representative M.C. for Youth). Members of the ARMY tend to be young, savvy, and into the latest technical developments like cryptos &#8211; in other words, the perfect place for Bitcoin scammers to attempt to build a following, gain credibility, and then rip people off.</p>\n<p>This was no ordinary scam. The perpetrators used a variety of ways and methods to advance their criminal cause. Some unscrupulous ARMY members had apparently sold their accounts to cryptocurrency companies or taken a commission in return for promoting them. Other influential members had innocently, or inadvertently, started following cryptocurrency accounts. And a number of cryptocurrency accounts had begun tagging ARMY members, offering BTS giveaways, merchandising, and albums.</p>\n<p>The idea was to hype up the attraction of cryptocurrencies and engage the attention of ARMY members. Conscious of the fact that many BTS fans were young, inexperienced, and impressionable, the cryptocurrency scammers hoped to phish for personal information that would enable them to hack into private accounts.</p>\n<p>It sounds like the perfect plan, but what happened next was really fascinating. Doubtless, an unspecified number of fans fell for the scam, but more significantly, many ARMY members were outraged by the idea that people were trying to rip off BTS fans. The group&rsquo;s own internal cybersecurity department hit back, with warnings to members about both the scam and the dangers of sharing personal information. And after prompting from ARMY members and other sources, Twitter suspended some of the implicated accounts.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, much of the ARMY&rsquo;s anger was directed not so much at the potential scam, but more at the lack of transparency from members &#8211; in particular, with regard to certain BTS fans sneakily trying to make money on the back of their fellow ARMY members.</p>\n<p>For the moment, things seem to have died down a little, but this story is a valuable reminder of the potential dangers of a Twitter cryptocurrency scam, and how easy it is to be ripped off.</p>\n<h2>Lessons to learn from the latest scam</h2>\n<p>For starters, as cryptocurrencies continue to grow in popularity, we can be sure that scammers will launch similar schemes in the future. Next, the need for vigilance is higher than ever, and not just around scammers. As this story illustrates, some influencers and high-profile accounts have zero principles and will do anything in return for a buck. However, alongside those unscrupulous influencers, there are also many good guys who make it their business to fight back against the bad guys.</p>\n<p>The famous British statesman Winston Churchill once wrote &ldquo;Those that fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.&rdquo; Those words certainly apply to the Twitter crypto scam that hit BTS and their ARMY of fans. But what other lessons can we learn from this episode?</p>\n<p>Perhaps the biggest lessons to learn are the most obvious ones: the need to take care on all social media platforms, and to be extremely careful about who you follow, what links you click, and what personal information you share with others.</p>\n<p>You can be sure that those who lost money, or who were taken in by the scammers, will be more careful next time. But is there any comeback for people who lost out to Bitcoin scammers? You may be surprised by the answer to that question, as there is a potential solution.</p>\n<h2>You can recover scammed Bitcoin today!</h2>\n<p>Cryptocurrency scammers are attracted to Bitcoin because of the lack of regulation, its anonymous nature, and the difficulty of tracing transactions. That might make you think that all is lost if you&rsquo;ve been the victim of a Twitter Bitcoin scam. However, we at Payback think differently. We&rsquo;ve been helping victims of online fraud since 2008, and in that time, we&rsquo;ve <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/success-calculator/\">successfully recovered</a> many millions of dollars for our clients.</p>\n<p>At Payback, our specialist team has a unique mix of technical, legal, and financial expertise.

            "content": "<p>As we live through some of the most turbulent economic times in recent history, it&rsquo;s totally understandable that more of us are looking for much safer places to squirrel away our savings, but are there any perfect risk-free investments out there, and how do we navigate today&rsquo;s marketplace?</p>\n<h2>The Benefits of Investing</h2>\n<p>Whatever the state of the economy or the stock market, there will always be good opportunities to be found. Some of the benefits that you can reap include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enjoy compound interest &#8211; The longer you&rsquo;re willing to invest for and ride out any market bumps, the more you&rsquo;ll benefit from compound interest</li>\n<li>It can provide tax benefits &#8211; If you invest in a 401K, traditional IRA, or SEP IRA, you won&rsquo;t pay tax on the year you earned it. Bonds are another great choice because any interest you earn won&rsquo;t be taxed at the federal level, and many states provide tax breaks too</li>\n<li>It helps you focus on a goal and build wealth &#8211; Whether you&rsquo;re planning a dream family vacation, making home improvements, or building a retirement pot, investing will keep you on track</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What Are the Risks of Investing?</h2>\n<p>We need to caveat this section by saying you&rsquo;ll never find a 100% non-risk investment. There are many financial advisors out there who might promise this, but the truth is, every type of investment will always come with some degree of risk, even if this is very small.</p>\n<p>Before you make any financial decision, make sure you completely understand what might happen to your money should the worst happen. Some common pitfalls to watch out for include:</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/e1f234fa31c2d80328241c494a139337.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/e1f234fa31c2d80328241c494a139337.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"389\"></picture></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Market risk &#8211; If you invest in the stock market there&rsquo;s no guarantee that you&rsquo;ll make money. A company riding high one day can collapse the next; make sure to diversify your portfolio</li>\n<li>Inflation risk &#8211; Some less risky investments might grow very slowly, meaning they&rsquo;ll be outpaced by inflation, losing you money in terms of buying power</li>\n<li>Liquidity risk &#8211; If you&rsquo;re invested in assets like property or penny stocks, you&rsquo;ll find them difficult to convert into cash. Don&rsquo;t invest in these if you need money quickly</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Types of Low-Risk Investments</h2>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve weighed up the pros and cons of investing, opting for some less risky investments like the ones below is a great way to dip your toe in the water:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>High-yield savings accounts &#8211; A very popular form of investment offered by most banks, and the closest you&rsquo;ll get to a risk-free investment. Your savings are backed up by the government under the FDIC for up to $250,000</li>\n<li>Savings bonds &#8211; Bought directly from the US Department of the Treasury, these are an incredibly safe bet, though they often coming with some measly returns. You also lose interest if you cash out early</li>\n<li>Dividend-paying stocks &#8211; A little riskier than the above two options, but still a fairly safe bet. Offered by larger, more successful companies, you purchase shares with the promise of regular payouts</li>\n<li>Money-market funds &#8211; Probably the best choice for those wanting to invest in the stock market. This is a diversified portfolio of cash and high-credit rating securities designed to provide a short-term return. It&rsquo;s rare for this type of investment to fail, but it can happen</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Can You Make Low-Risk Investments and Expect a Good Return?</h2>\n<p>Generally, the lower the risk of your investment, the lower your return. As detailed above, some of the least risky investments can struggle to keep up with inflation. In fact, many people take the low-risk route just as a way to consistently save money. This is best for those that aren&rsquo;t looking for life-changing returns.</p>\n<p>However, that doesn&rsquo;t mean to say you can&rsquo;t find options out there that don&rsquo;t make at least a decent profit. You may be able to find some fixed-rate savings accounts and annuities that net you a good interest rate, but you shouldn&rsquo;t enter into any of the investments covered here with unreasonably high expectations</p>\n<h2>Is It Possible to Reduce Risks With Fewer Options?</h2>\n<p>Rather than spread yourself too thin over multiple investments, you might be able to reduce your risk by focusing on just one or two very secure options. For example, you might want to try an S&amp;P 500 index fund, which is a mixture of stocks covering the top 500 companies in the US.</p>\n<p>Since the index was founded in 1957, it&rsquo;s weathered every financial storm and recession, and offered consistent growth. If you&rsquo;re able to commit long term, this sort of investment is the ideal option for those looking for a retirement plan and should create above-inflation returns.</p>\n<h2>What Else to Watch Out For When Investing</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/protect-yourself-from-common-online-scams/\">Fraud and scams</a> &#8211; If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. Look out for shady organizations charging massive fees, pressuring you for up-front payments, promises of tax-free investments, and <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/identify-and-avoid-pyramid-schemes/\">pyramid schemes</a>. Make sure you thoroughly research any organization before you invest</li>\n<li>Social and political factors &#8211; Recessions, pandemics, and government instability can all end up losing you money. This is just another reminder of the importance of having a diverse portfolio</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How To Recover From Being Scammed</h2>\n<p>Luckily, many less risky investments, like government bonds and savings accounts, are heavily regulated, and as long as you keep your wits about you, there&rsquo;s a very low chance of being scammed. However, if you&#8217;ve fallen victim to fraudsters, you do have some recourse <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/\">to get your money back</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Credit/debit card refunds &#8211; If you paid for your investment using a credit or debit card, there&rsquo;s a good chance you can <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/a-guide-to-chargebacks-recover-your-funds-after-a-scam/\">recover your cash via a chargeback</a> where your bank will request money back from the scammer&rsquo;s account.

            "content": "<p>Think cryptocurrency, and most people immediately think of Bitcoin. Amazingly, the king of cryptocurrency was first released and traded as recently as 2009. From small beginnings, experts now reckon Bitcoin has an astonishing market capitalization of over $350 billion. It&rsquo;s clear that Bitcoin is here to stay.</p>\n<p>Where Bitcoin led, other cryptocurrencies followed. Although Bitcoin continues to eclipse its rivals in terms of size, alternatives like EOS, Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero and ripple (XRP) have their fans, plus the forthcoming launch of Libra (supported by Facebook) promises to have a major impact on the market.</p>\n<p>Just like physical currencies, the value of cryptocurrencies goes up and down, and you can buy and sell just as you would trade forex. Increasingly, you can use them to make purchases from vendors, plus PayPal has started to roll out support for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Whilst some people have made huge profits very quickly by investing in cryptos, that same price volatility means that they are often seen as a high-risk venture.</p>\n<p>All of which rather begs the question: is cryptocurrency legal? For the most part, the answer is yes, but read on to learn more about the legalities and intricacies of digital currencies &#8211; plus how to <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/how-to-avoid-forex-scams/\">avoid some of the more prevalent scams</a>, and how these &ldquo;unconventional&rdquo; currencies are becoming increasingly mainstream.</p>\n<h2>Is Cryptocurrency Legal, The Importance Of Geography And Different Types Of Currency</h2>\n<p>A few smaller countries have outlawed certain cryptocurrencies, but in most of the major economies across the world, they remain legal.</p>\n<p>Because of Bitcoin&rsquo;s size and dominance, some jurisdictions have already moved to introduce regulations around this market leader. However, other cryptos remain untouched by regulation. The internet moves fast where governments move slow, so perhaps this patchwork approach is hardly surprising. It remains to be seen whether rules and regulations will be extended to all cryptocurrencies, but it seems highly likely that we can expect increased regulation in this area. The EU, for example, has already published draft proposals for a new law on crypto-assets.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/295d1132f19fe167f750870b7a6c910f.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/295d1132f19fe167f750870b7a6c910f.jpg\" width=\"510\" height=\"340\"></picture></p>\n<p>That said, when it comes to regulating digital currencies, to a large extent the hands of governments are tied. Indeed, for many investors, the attraction of cryptocurrencies is precisely that they fall outside of the regulation, influence, and interference of national governments. Some observers even wonder whether it is legally &#8211; or indeed morally &#8211; acceptable for governments to legislate in areas that lie beyond their own borders.</p>\n<h2>Is Bitcoin Safe And Legal?</h2>\n<p>In terms of market capitalization, Bitcoin is nearly nine times bigger than its nearest competitor, so it&rsquo;s worth looking at this crypto Goliath in a little more detail. Naturally, Bitcoin&rsquo;s dominant position has caught the eye of national governments and regulators, and some major countries &#8211; notably Canada, China, and Russia &#8211; have introduced restrictions and regulations around banking with Bitcoin. Other countries have chosen to take a lighter touch, or are still considering their options.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin legal issues are many and complex, and they differ country by country. It should be noted that pretty much all of these legal issues apply equally to other cryptocurrencies. Depending on where you live, you may be required to pay tax on earnings, keep records of accounts, register with the authorities if you are a financial services business, and have an anti-money laundering policy in place.</p>\n<p>So is Bitcoin legal and is it safe? Assuming you are following the rules and regulations, broadly speaking the answer is a resounding YES!</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/1bfc540c0863f32e5397a917d5220ac7.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/1bfc540c0863f32e5397a917d5220ac7.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"250\"></picture></p>\n<h2>The Biggest Legal Issues With Cryptocurrency</h2>\n<p>Currently, the biggest legal issues around cryptocurrencies concern crimes like money-laundering, and the funding of terrorism. Opponents of digital currencies say that by allowing third-party payments from anonymous sources, cryptocurrencies may be facilitating criminal and terrorist activities.</p>\n<p>Given the anonymity of such transactions, it is difficult to conclusively prove or disprove such accusations. However, the fact that organizations like the G7 have highlighted this issue does mean that cryptocurrencies will continue to face a degree of scrutiny in the future. There is no smoke without fire.</p>\n<p>Against that background, however, it should also be said that it seems likely that most investors in cryptocurrencies are legal and above board: if the authorities were really concerned, surely they would have already moved to close down and ban such currencies.</p>\n<h2>Use Case And Potential Difficulties In Handling Cryptocurrency</h2>\n<p>Cryptocurrency exchange and make your purchase. You can also buy via websites, stores or ATMs.</p>\n<p>Probably the biggest difficulty in handling cryptocurrency comes when you want to withdraw your money. This can frequently be a long, slow and laborious process. Unhelpful brokers, sneaky terms and conditions, and the lack of companies who accept cryptos are all additional barriers. On a more positive note, though, as cryptocurrencies evolve, many of these issues are being addressed and overcome.</p>\n<h2>Cryptocurrency And Fraud</h2>\n<p>Financial trading and fraud frequently go together, and sadly cryptocurrency is no exception to that rule. Normally with financial trading, it goes without saying that you should only ever use the services of a regulated broker. But with cryptocurrencies, that&rsquo;s not always possible. By their very nature, cryptocurrencies exist beyond the control of governments and regulators, so that means you must tread very carefully when making any investments.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/aec1c5c8e5d36662e9f078f3aaa3908d.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/aec1c5c8e5d36662e9f078f3aaa3908d.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"183\"></picture></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/17-cryptocurrency-investment-scams-you-must-know-about/\">Common cryptocurrency scams</a> include Ponzi schemes, theft from e-wallets, phoney ICOs (initial coin offerings), dishonest market manipulation, and fraudulent exchanges.

However, dedicated funds recovery professionals like <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/\">PayBack</a> may be able to help you.

            "content": "<p>Binary options and forex are two of the most popular forms of trading. Whilst they share many common characteristics, they also have a number of fundamental differences. Let&rsquo;s start off with a brief look at the history of each, before explaining how they work, and the pros and cons of forex trading vs binary options. You can quickly jump to information on <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/forex-scams/\">Forex Scams</a> and <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/binary-options-scams/\">Binary Options scams</a> here.</p>\n<p>Forex in its present-day form essentially began in 1971, when President Nixon took the decision to allow the US dollar to float freely against other currencies. As currencies fluctuated in value against one another, speculators could make a profit, essentially by buying low and selling high.</p>\n<p>The introduction of the Euro greatly reduced the number of tradable currencies, but ultimately this had little impact on the popularity of forex. The rise of the internet and increasing globalization made forex even more widespread, and today it continues to be the largest and most liquid market in the world.</p>\n<p>Binary options are a much more recent arrival. The market as we know it today can trace its formation back to 2008, when the US Securities and Exchange Commission gave its approval for this form of trading. Other countries and regulators soon followed suit, and with binary options now available to retail traders, the market soon soared.</p>\n<p>Binary options are also known as all-or-nothing options. If you correctly predict that an asset will be worth above a certain value at a certain time, you make a profit. But if your prediction is wrong, you lose all of your investment.</p>\n<p>In recent times, some regulators have moved to ban binary options, amid concerns about rigged markets, fraud, and unfair trading conditions. Nonetheless, in the countries where they&rsquo;re still legal, binary options remain a popular choice, so in the great forex vs binary battle, which one is for you? Read on for more information to help you decide.</p>\n<h2>How Does Forex Work?</h2>\n<p>Forex, or foreign exchange to give it its full name, is defined as the transfer of currency from one party to another, at a mutually acceptable price. If you&rsquo;ve ever traveled abroad, you&rsquo;ll have made a forex transaction to buy some local currency. But the vast majority of forex transactions aren&rsquo;t made for holiday or business purposes: in most cases, profit is the motive!</p>\n<p>When you return from your holidays with unspent foreign currency, you soon learn that when you change it back, the rates have changed. Sometimes you get a better deal, and more money back, but other times, you lose out. And that&rsquo;s precisely how forex investment works, albeit on a much, much larger scale. Investors try to buy when a currency is low, in the hope that it will rise in value against other currencies.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/eb969a1e36ec36561f98b127464bf4dc.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/eb969a1e36ec36561f98b127464bf4dc.jpg\" width=\"510\" height=\"340\"></picture></p>\n<p>There are several different types of forex trading, including spot markets, forward markets, future markets, options markets, and swaps markets.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/978e6e0f533b17d462a30fd421e7a122.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/978e6e0f533b17d462a30fd421e7a122.jpg\" width=\"510\" height=\"340\"></picture></p>\n<h2>How Does Binary Trading Work?</h2>\n<p>Binary options have become popular with investors for a number of reasons: the process is super easy, you can predict potential winnings and losses, you don&rsquo;t need a huge initial investment, and you&rsquo;re not dependent on what is happening in stock markets.</p>\n<p>The principle behind binary options is simple. You make a prediction that the value of a certain asset is above a certain value at a certain time. That asset could take the form of a stock, a share, a commodity, or forex. If your prediction is right, you win. But if you&rsquo;re wrong, you lose all your stake.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a simplified example of binary trade. Let&rsquo;s say $1 dollar is currently worth &pound;0.75. A binary option at $55 offers you a strike price value of &pound;0.78, expiring on Friday at 17.00 GMT. If the final value is &pound;0.78 or above, you win, and your option is worth $100.00. You make a $45 profit ($100 minus your original stake of $55). But if the exchange rate is less than &pound;0.78, you lose all of your $55.</p>\n<p>It is possible to make money with binary options, but remember that some countries have banned them over concerns of <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/binary-options-scams/\">binary options fraud</a> and unfair business practices.</p>\n<h2>The Pros And Cons Of Forex Vs Binary Options: A Comparison</h2>\n<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of other trading and investment options, and you may come to the conclusion that binary options and forex are not for you. That&rsquo;s perfectly fine, although it does mean you might be missing out on potential opportunities. If you do decide to trade in these markets, it goes without saying that you can greatly enhance your chances of success through practice, and by increasing your specific knowledge of the area.</p>\n<p>The pros of forex include easy accessibility, high liquidity, fast trades, greater transparency, less market manipulation, plus reasonable fees. The cons include exchange rate volatility, lack of global regulation, and a potential in-built bias against smaller investors.</p>\n<p>The pros of binary options include their simplicity, predictability (fixed amount of win or loss), quick payouts, plus the ability to invest small amounts. The cons include rigged markets, expensive fees, all-or-nothing results, and the prevalence of scammers.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick overview of some of the relative merits of binary options vs forex:</p>\n<table style=\"width: 600px\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"200\"></td>\n<td width=\"200\"><strong>Forex</strong></td>\n<td width=\"200\"><strong>Binary Options</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Simplicity</strong></td>\n<td>Easy</td>\n<td>Easy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Risk factor</strong></td>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>Capped</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Stability</strong></td>\n<td>Volatile</td>\n<td>Predictable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Potential return</strong></td>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Scamming risk</strong></td>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>High</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Legal</strong></td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td>Limited</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Automated trading</strong></td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n<td width=\"201\">Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"201\"><strong>Accessibility</strong></td>\n<td width=\"201\">24/5</td>\n<td width=\"201\">Market operating hours</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Your Options If You&rsquo;ve Been Scammed</h2>\n<p>The success, ubiquity and simplicity of the internet is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it greatly facilitates online trading in forex and binary options, but on the other, it hugely increases the scope for investors to be ripped off. <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/12-easy-ways-to-check-if-a-website-is-legit-or-a-scam/\">Fake websites</a>, rogue brokers, <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/blacklisted-brands/\">unregulated brokers</a>, broken promises, dishonest deals and other cons are sadly all too common.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve been ripped off, your first step should always be to complain to your broker, and if that fails, to your national regulator. However, if you&rsquo;ve been using the services of an unregulated broker or an overseas company, those choices might not be open to you. In such cases, the best option is to employ a dedicated funds recovery expert: <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/\">Payback</a> is a leading example. With their experienced teams of legal and financial professionals, funds recovery companies have a successful track record of helping victims of scammers to get their money back.</p>\n",

            "content": "<p>It seems counter-intuitive, but negative interest rates are now a reality in several countries across the world. Institutions and high-worth individuals with money in savings accounts are actually seeing the value of their assets fall. This unprecedented situation raises important questions about high risk investment strategies. If you&rsquo;re losing money by leaving it in the bank, is it time to consider other investment opportunities where you can get a better return on your assets?</p>\n<p>Before answering that question, it&rsquo;s important to state that negative interest rates aren&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing. Having a significant cash balance in the bank still provides security and certainty, but unless you specifically require short term liquidity, it may not be the best long term investment policy.</p>\n<p>Faced with negative interest rates, many investors are now seriously re-evaluating their strategies. Do they look at risky investments with high returns, or choose safe and steady options with lower rewards? A mixture of both, perhaps? Or how about investing in venture capital, emerging foreign markets, binary options, or cryptocurrencies?</p>\n<p>With a high-risk investment, you could make a fortune&hellip; or you could lose everything. Does that mean you should set your sights lower and settle for a smaller but safer return? Read on to learn more about your options, and how to stay safe in the choppy waters of financial investment!</p>\n<h2>What Are Your Options?</h2>\n<p>Before you make any decisions on your investment strategy, you should be aware of all the options. That may sound like an obvious thing to say, but many people are unaware of all the different types of financial products available. As an example, a corporate client who leaves money in a savings account for reasons of liquidity may actually find that government bonds deliver higher yields with the same levels of access.</p>\n<p>The other important factor at play here is that financial markets never stay still. Granted, the old investment staples of stocks and bonds continue to be popular, but new markets and opportunities are springing up all the time. A few short years ago, very few people invested in cryptocurrencies, but now they&rsquo;re the latest thing.</p>\n<p>So look at all the options: from traditional staples like forex, stocks, bonds, mutual funds and index funds, to more exciting options like venture cap, emerging markets, binary options and cryptocurrencies. It all depends on what sort of investor you are: someone who likes the thrill of a high-risk investment, or someone who prefers a safer, more conservative approach.</p>\n<p>Regardless of which type of investor you are, there&rsquo;s one piece of advice that holds true across the board: only ever invest your money with a registered company. An unregulated broker might promise you the moon and stars, but the world is full of people who have lost all their money after investing with a fraudulent company. You have been warned!</p>\n<h2>The Benefits Of Consulting With A Professional</h2>\n<p>The benefits of choosing a registered financial professional far outweigh the risks of working with an unregulated broker. First, you can be sure that you&rsquo;re working with an experienced, qualified expert: you can avail of their specialist knowledge for advice on your portfolio, taxation and investment options. Next, you have the security and peace of mind that come from working with a company that conforms to industry regulations. And finally, if anything does go wrong, you at least have some form of a comeback with the regulator.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/7f82beb55e0a316c7e282264b66230a9.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/7f82beb55e0a316c7e282264b66230a9.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"318\"></picture></p>\n<p>Everywhere you look, there are hard-luck stories of people who lost everything by working with unregulated brokers and traders. Don&rsquo;t fall for the hype, and don&rsquo;t be taken in by the promise of unreal returns: stay safe by choosing a registered professional!</p>\n<h2>Risk And Return: Your Choice</h2>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/fef383d4ac642cae88db50b642b26507.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/fef383d4ac642cae88db50b642b26507.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"277\"></picture></p>\n<p>For investors who like to stay safe and play the long-term game, the solutions are clear: savings accounts, government bonds, securities and the like are lower yield, but they offer high security. If you&rsquo;re prepared to take a risk with your money, however, you could win big. The riskiest investments might see you lose everything&hellip; but equally, they could end up making you very rich indeed!</p>\n<p>Here are the pros and cons of some of the more exciting forms of investment, with a high-level assessment of the risks and potential returns involved:</p>\n<h3>Venture Capital</h3>\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Chance to be in at the beginning, enjoyable to see your investment grow</p>\n<p><strong>Cons</strong>: Longer-term investment, most start-ups fail</p>\n<p><strong>Risk</strong>: Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Potential Return</strong>s: Medium to High</p>\n<h3>Emerging Foreign Markets</h3>\n<p><strong>Pros</strong>: First-mover advantage, huge opportunities</p>\n<p><strong>Cons</strong>: Exchange rate fluctuations, political instability</p>\n<p><strong>Risk</strong>: Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Potential Returns</strong>: Medium to High</p>\n<h3>Binary Options Trading</h3>\n<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Quick and easy trading, not dependent on what&rsquo;s happening in the markets</p>\n<p><strong>Cons</strong>: Rigged options, prevalence of scammers</p>\n<p><strong>Risk</strong>: High</p>\n<p><strong>Potential Returns</strong>: High</p>\n<h3>Cryptocurrency Trading</h3>\n<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Growing market, quick liquidity</p>\n<p><strong>Cons</strong>: Volatility, prevalence of scammers</p>\n<p><strong>Risk</strong>: High</p>\n<p><strong>Potential Returns</strong>: High</p>\n<h2>What To Do If You&rsquo;ve Been Scammed</h2>\n<p>With new forms of high risk, high return trading, the chances of being scammed are always greater. Investors are attracted by the chance of making a fortune, and crooks are attracted by the opportunity to scam investors who may not know enough about the market.</p>\n<p>The first port of call if you think you&rsquo;ve been ripped off is to contact your broker and ask for recompense. If that doesn&rsquo;t work, then complain to your national financial regulator. Of course, if you&rsquo;ve been working with an unregulated company, or with a broker overseas, you may find that you have no obvious method of redress.</p>\n<p>People who&rsquo;ve been scammed or ripped off with <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/cryptocurrency-scams/\">cryptocurrency</a> or <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/binary-options-scams/\">binary options</a> often believe that their money is gone for good, especially if their broker was unregulated or overseas. If that sounds like you, you should definitely explore your options with a dedicated funds recovery expert like <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/\">PayBack</a>. Such companies employ experienced legal and financial professionals, and their expertise can get you your money back where other approaches have failed. It&rsquo;s well worth speaking to them if you&rsquo;ve been scammed in any sort of financial trading: you have nothing to lose, and everything to gain.</p>\n",

Read on to learn more, and to understand why some people have concerns about whether binary options are legit and <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/binary-options-scams/\">binary options scams</a> are rife.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Are Binary Options Legal?</h2>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re asking the question &ldquo;Is binary options trading legal?&rdquo;, the answer is ultimately dependent on where you live. Binary options are legit in many of the world&rsquo;s leading financial markets, in countries like China, Japan, and the USA. However, they&rsquo;re currently banned in a number of other major countries, such as Canada, France, Germany, and the UK.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/14d078f57a137bb3fad8f51343396488.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/14d078f57a137bb3fad8f51343396488.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"439\"></picture></p>\n<p>There are many reasons why binary options aren&rsquo;t legit in these countries. Primary amongst the concerns are the risks of fraud, unfair trading conditions, and unease about how certain companies in the sector operate.</p>\n<p>If binary options trading isn&rsquo;t legit where you live, you may still be able to trade by using a broker in an overseas country. But if you&rsquo;re going down this road, you should be aware that you may be working with an unregulated or poorly regulated broker.</p>\n<h2>How Are Binary Options Regulated?</h2>\n<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to note that in some jurisdictions, binary options are (or at least were) regulated not by the relevant financial services authority, but by the gambling commission. In the UK, for example, binary options were originally regulated by the UK Gambling Commission, before responsibility passed to the Financial Conduct Authority in January 2018. That fact alone is enough to sound the alarm bells for some investors, and to some extent, it reinforces the claims that binary options are a form of fixed-odds betting.</p>\n<p>In the EU and UK, in recent times regulators have moved to largely ban binary options trading. Thus if you are looking to use a broker outside of your country, it goes without saying that you should always choose a company that&rsquo;s fully licensed, ideally in a country that has a robust track record for regulation. As an example, in the USA, brokers selling binary options are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/507eeed4331c9548f57ea6a8a2ff0334.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/507eeed4331c9548f57ea6a8a2ff0334.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"389\"></picture></p>\n<h2>The Controversy Around Binary Options</h2>\n<p>A quick search of the internet will reveal many articles and stories that cast doubt upon the legality and fairness of binary options. Opponents of binary options &#8211; and that includes many financial regulators &#8211; claim that the products are inherently flawed, and don&rsquo;t give investors a fair chance. They say that the odds are stacked against investors, and that a roulette wheel in a casino offers a better chance of success.</p>\n<p>Although there are undoubtedly many firms that trade within the rules, equally, it cannot be denied that there have been several high profile cases where dishonest brokers have been fined huge sums for fraud, malpractice, and ripping off clients.</p>\n<h2>Fraudsters &amp; Binary Options</h2>\n<p>Critics of binary options are quick to mention the proven connections between fraudsters and this form of trading. They point to a number of notorious stories in the press where brokers have been charged with and found guilty of financial irregularities.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the rights and wrongs of the binary options industry, however, it&rsquo;s only fair to highlight that many other companies in the financial services sector have been found guilty of sharp practices. Moreover, there are many fully regulated, reputable binary options brokers that operate legally within the rules and regulations.</p>\n<p>Having read this far, you&rsquo;re probably getting the message that yes, binary options trading is legit in some countries, and yes, you can make money with this form of trading, but you absolutely need to take the greatest care, both in your selection of a broker, and when trading.</p>\n<h2>How To Protect Yourself, And What To Do If You Have Been Scammed</h2>\n<p>Given that the sale of binary options is now banned in so many countries, there is a higher likelihood that any company offering such services may be fraudulent. Watch out for schemes that promise unbelievable returns, or companies that take your money, refuse to return it, and then break off all contact. Many rogue brokers have highly professional-looking websites, supposedly but fraudulently endorsed by well-known names. It&rsquo;s easy to be taken in, so exercise extreme caution at all times.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/38ac99314ff122f2a61b616c1fe079ab.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/38ac99314ff122f2a61b616c1fe079ab.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"450\"></picture></p>\n<p>If you find out that you have been scammed, you have a number of options. You can make a complaint to the relevant financial regulator, although you may face issues if you are not resident in the country where the trade was made, plus regulators in some countries have comparatively limited powers.</p>\n<p>For that reason, your best option may be to use a dedicated funds recovery service. With an expert team of legal, banking and binary options professionals on your side, you may be able to get back some or all of your funds.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>With discipline, hard work and a little luck, it is possible to make money from binary options. The convenience, speed and ease of this form of trading also make it an attractive choice. However, the fact that binary options are no longer legal in a number of important markets means that you need to tread with extreme caution: make sure any broker you work with is properly regulated, for example, and make sure you fully understand how the system works. And if you do fall foul of a fraud or scam, remember that the regulator or a <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/\">professional funds recovery firm</a> may be able to help you.</p>\n<p>So that&rsquo;s the case for binary options.

            "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Nowadays, thanks to the Internet, it&rsquo;s extremely easy for anyone to go online and start trading in forex. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s also just as easy to fall victim to any number of <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/forex-scams/\">forex frauds</a>, from phony brokers to dishonest &ldquo;expert&rdquo; advisors; from sham dummy companies to rogue automated trading systems.</p>\n<p>The potential for so much online trading fraud shouldn&rsquo;t necessarily put you off the forex market, but it should at the very least remind you of the need to be careful, cautious, and conscientious.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve been unlucky enough to have fraudulently lost money in forex, read on for ten tips on how to ensure it doesn&rsquo;t happen again. Whilst this advice is pertinent to victims of forex frauds, it&rsquo;s also highly relevant to newcomers and experienced traders alike: with forex, you never stop learning!</p>\n<h2>1. Don&rsquo;t Get Scammed Again</h2>\n<p>Emotions can run high when you realize that you&rsquo;ve been scammed, but it&rsquo;s important that you remain cool, calm, and collected. First, immediately ensure that the scammers have no further access to your money: cancel any subscriptions, and block access to your bank account, for example.</p>\n<p>Even established and trusted companies have been known to break the rules, so if there&rsquo;s a grievance procedure in place, use it. Alternatively, if the company is regulated, make a formal complaint to the regulator. For companies that play hardball or that are possibly unregulated, you should consider using a <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/\">dedicated funds recovery firm</a> (see step 2 below).</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/2d651300e7bd817dbe9d7a07b50a0e2c.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/2d651300e7bd817dbe9d7a07b50a0e2c.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"390\"></picture></p>\n<p>Every single person who trades in forex has made mistakes and losses along the way. But clever and successful traders analyze the reasons behind the loss, learn from their mistakes, and use that knowledge to inform their future decisions.</p>\n<h2>2. Use An Expert To Get Your Money Back</h2>\n<p>In cases where you&rsquo;ve been treated unfairly and illegally, you may think that your money is gone forever. However, there are dedicated, professional companies that can help you recover your funds &#8211; <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/\">Payback</a> being one such example. These companies employ seasoned experts from the forex, legal, and banking professions, and you can avail of their long experience to help you get your money back.</p>\n<p>In some instances, the threat of legal action is enough to shame scammers into action, but the best fund recovery firms will also start litigation on your behalf where there&rsquo;s a provable case. Regrettably, in some cases, funds are irrecoverable, but if you&rsquo;ve been scammed and lost money in forex, this option is definitely worth exploring in more depth.</p>\n<h2>3. Use An Established Broker Or System</h2>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/9ef0769f569ab60239930f922148cd17.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/9ef0769f569ab60239930f922148cd17.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"389\"></picture></p>\n<p>Forex frauds come in many forms, but the majority of scams are perpetrated by unregulated or poorly regulated firms. As they used to say as far back as Roman times, &ldquo;Caveat emptor&rdquo; &#8211; let the buyer beware. Remember, prevention is better than cure. Before you choose a broker or automated trading system, do your research, ask friends and colleagues for advice, check the company&rsquo;s credentials for yourself, and most of all, don&rsquo;t fall for excessive marketing hype.</p>\n<p>This step may be a case of being wise after the event, but it&rsquo;s important that you don&rsquo;t make the same mistake twice. Choose your broker or automated trading system with care in the first place, and you can <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/how-to-avoid-forex-scams/\">avoid most, if not all, forex trading fraud</a>.</p>\n<h2>4. Detach From Emotional Trading</h2>\n<p>No-one likes admitting they&rsquo;re wrong, but if you want to make a success of forex trading, you need to be able to detach and self-reflect on the reasons why you lost out. In some respects, forex trading is like gambling, so make sure you aren&rsquo;t like that player who gambles more and more to cover their escalating losses.</p>\n<p>In extreme cases, you may simply have to accept the reality that forex trading isn&rsquo;t for you. Alternatively, you can reduce or eliminate the emotional element by working more closely with an experienced broker, or through the use of an automated trading system.</p>\n<h2>5. Develop Your Knowledge &amp; Experience</h2>\n<p>It may be a bitter pill to swallow, but perhaps the reason for your losses is that you lack knowledge and experience. There&rsquo;s an argument that says that you can learn by doing, but if you take that approach with forex, you risk learning some very hard &#8211; and very expensive! &#8211; lessons!</p>\n<p>So do your homework, do your research, and expand your knowledge. There are plenty of free practice accounts out there that let you hone your skills before you move on to the real thing, so take advantage of them. Better still, your greater experience will help you spot fraudsters more easily.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/8cec528042231c05b7019a9e8bd2e4a9.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/8cec528042231c05b7019a9e8bd2e4a9.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"387\"></picture></p>\n<h2>6. Manage Your Risks</h2>\n<p>The rules for risk management are deceptively simple: the higher the risk, the greater the chance of a bigger return&hellip; but the chance of major losses is also higher. That apparent simplicity shouldn&rsquo;t blind you to the critical importance of a well-thought-out, risk-management strategy.</p>\n<p>It might sound like common sense &#8211; indeed it <em>is </em>common sense! &#8211; but if you want to avoid significant losses due to online trading fraud, you should always have a robust risk/reward ratio management plan in place, long before you even start to think about trading!</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/d1b21325de04a688f5e4ff91c03e430f.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/d1b21325de04a688f5e4ff91c03e430f.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"390\"></picture></p>\n<h2>7. Fail To Plan, Plan To Fail</h2>\n<p>It may well be the oldest cliche in the book, but it&rsquo;s true: &ldquo;Fail to Plan, Plan to Fail.&rdquo; A well-constructed and fully thought through trading plan is worth its weight in gold, and will help you to avoid costly mistakes. Your plan should include elements like your personal objectives, entry and exit rules, currencies and markets covered, tactics and strategies, risk management and, perhaps the most important of all, position sizing.</p>\n<p>Forex markets are notoriously volatile, however, so remember to constantly review, monitor, and update your plan.</p>\n<h2>8. Adapt, Adapt, Adapt</h2>\n<p>For many traders, one of the main attractions of forex is that it&rsquo;s a market in constant flux. Every day sees new economic developments, regulatory changes, political revolutions, and trade deals that impact the market. And that means that every day sees new opportunities&hellip; and new risks.</p>\n<p>Those constant changes also mean that the ability to adapt is crucial if you want to succeed in the forex market. The most successful traders are those who can anticipate the impact of new developments, and those who can react the most speedily to change.</p>\n<h2>9. Don&rsquo;t Overtrade</h2>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re new to the game, if you&rsquo;re on a roll, or if you&rsquo;re chasing a loss, there can be a tendency to overtrade &#8211; in other words, to make too many transactions, or to make a transaction that&rsquo;s too large. The advice here is simple and wise &#8211; don&rsquo;t overtrade!</p>\n<p>Naturally, this step ties in closely with the advice on risk management and planning. It&rsquo;s all too easy to get swept up in the emotion of the moment and regret things afterward. If you have a proper plan in place, one that includes risk management, then you can avoid the dangers of overtrading: excessive losses, burnouts, poor decision-making, and depressing thoughts of what might have been.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/4b92d9b1e842fc1302ef912870114bf1.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/4b92d9b1e842fc1302ef912870114bf1.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"290\"></picture></p>\n<h2>10. Be Realistic</h2>\n<p>Above all, and at all times, be realistic. If you&rsquo;ve had a good day, don&rsquo;t be too greedy and try to milk the trade to the very last drop: do so, and you run the risk of losing the gains you&rsquo;ve made. Many a trader has ended up kicking themselves for being too greedy!</p>\n<p>That same realism applies when you&rsquo;re making a loss. Don&rsquo;t be tempted to chase it and risk losing even more. With forex, there&rsquo;s always another day and another chance for you to be successful.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>When it comes to forex trading, often what you <em>don&rsquo;t</em> do is as important as what you do do! As an example, you should never invest more to cover a reverse without gaining a full understanding of why you made the loss in the first place. All that said, with foresight, patience, inspiration, experience and, most importantly, hard work, it&rsquo;s definitely possible to make a success of forex trading.</p>\n",

            "content": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>What could be simpler than an automated trading system? Just program a computer to buy or sell stocks, shares, and foreign exchange when certain criteria are met, and away you go. You can set the system up to sell when a share falls below a certain price or to buy euros when the exchange rate reaches a predetermined level. Or, you can program the computer to take into account a far more sophisticated set of circumstances and market conditions. Whichever approach you take, all you have to do is to sit back and watch your money grow. That&rsquo;s how it works, right?</p>\n<p>If only things were that easy! Whilst it&rsquo;s definitely possible to make serious money with automated trading systems, there are also a number of potential pitfalls and challenges, especially for newcomers. So read on to learn more about the benefits and possible risks of automated trading.</p>\n<h2>The Pros of Automated Trading</h2>\n<p>Probably the biggest advantage of an automated system is that it takes the emotion out of trading. A trader may get carried away in the excitement of a deal and go too far, or conversely panic and offload stocks too quickly. Automated trading literally takes a more logical approach.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/d551f7ec5f0e573d679585617558eb0e.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/d551f7ec5f0e573d679585617558eb0e.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"329\"></picture></p>\n<p>Another major advantage of automated trading is the use of a concept called &ldquo;backtesting&rdquo;, where historical data is used to predict what will happen in the future. Because of the extensive resources needed to track vast amounts of stock market data, backtesting used to be the preserve of a few large institutions, but in recent times, it&rsquo;s become more widespread.</p>\n<p>We human beings need to eat, rest, and sleep, and there&rsquo;s a limit to how much information we can process and store. Automated trading systems, on the other hand, have no such limitations. They work 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They can cover a boundless number of markets, and are able to respond immediately to any new developments, regardless of the time or day of the week.</p>\n<p>Convenient, efficient, speedy, accessible, non-stop, cost-effective, and with comprehensive market coverage, there&rsquo;s much to commend automated trading systems.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/ed02f2dad245d8ab8cd1e8cc0451461b.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/ed02f2dad245d8ab8cd1e8cc0451461b.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"390\"></picture></p>\n<h2>The Cons of Automated Trading Systems</h2>\n<p>Any computer system is only as good as the information and data you put into it. So if you&rsquo;re using automated trading, you need to make sure your strategies are the best. In fact, this area is probably the biggest downside of trading in this way. If you don&rsquo;t have automated trading strategies that work, you risk losing your money, or, just as bad, missing out on potential profits.</p>\n<p>There are other issues too. Something as simple as a power cut or a broken or slow internet connection is enough to make an automated trading system fail. Just like humans, such systems aren&rsquo;t infallible: they require constant monitoring to ensure that nothing is amiss.</p>\n<p>Automated trading systems are also complicated to design. If the underlying algorithms are incorrectly calibrated, or if certain fundamental market conditions change, there&rsquo;s a chance that the system may become compromised, and actually do the opposite of what it was intended to do.</p>\n<p>Finally, automated trading systems are rightly lauded because they take the emotion out of buying and selling, but that can be a double-edged sword. Many fortunes have been made by traders following a hunch, trusting their gut instinct, and making an inspired decision. With an automated system, such an approach isn&rsquo;t possible.</p>\n<h2>The Cons of Automated Trading Systems</h2>\n<p>As with all financial transactions, you need to be aware that there are several scams associated with automated trading systems. Some scammers charge you a subscription fee for access to great trading tips which are anything but. Watch out for phony investment companies that take your money then disappear overnight, or that empty your account after one or two trades and blame it on the markets. Other seemingly genuine brokers make it difficult or virtually impossible for you to withdraw your funds.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/f060f9908b14209c1d276b16b7b45a6c.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/f060f9908b14209c1d276b16b7b45a6c.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"389\"></picture></p>\n<p>The good news is that with a little common sense, it&rsquo;s easy enough to spot most of the scammers. Make sure that any company you work with is fully regulated and licensed. Don&rsquo;t be taken in by 100% risk-free guarantees and the promise of huge returns. Always read the small print, and look for proof of the company&rsquo;s trading record. Read the online reviews and double-check that the company has a physical presence and staff who are listed on social media sites like LinkedIn. And be very careful about what personal information you share.</p>\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve decided that automatic trading is for you, it&rsquo;s vital that you fully understand what you&rsquo;re getting into. Do your research: it can be a profitable way of making money, but it&rsquo;s definitely not for everyone, especially if you have a limited understanding of how stock markets and forex operate.</p>\n<p>Automated trading systems typically work by connecting a software platform to a direct access broker. That means that your choice of broker is especially important. Before you sign up with anyone, ask for the answers to these questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can you provide evidence of your track record?</li>\n<li>How much do you charge, and how &#8211; flat rate, commission, sliding scale?</li>\n<li>What markets do you cover?</li>\n<li>Can I personalize my own settings for risks and returns?</li>\n<li>Is the system set up for short term or long term gains?</li>\n<li>How easy is it for me to withdraw funds?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask questions, especially if you&rsquo;re new to the game. A genuine broker will be happy to help you. And remember that if you&rsquo;re unlucky enough to fall victim to a <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/forex-scams/\">forex fraud</a> or <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/stock-trading-scams/\">trading scam</a>, there are expert companies out there who may be able to help you get your money back.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt that automated trading should have a place in the portfolio of every serious investor. However, it&rsquo;s crucial that you understand the markets in general before you jump in, and also that you continuously monitor and maintain your system.</p>\n",

Here are some common-sense suggestions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Get wise to the tactics used by scammers</b>: don&rsquo;t fall for irresistible offers, false promises, and misleading 100% guarantees</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Do your homework before you start and don&rsquo;t invest in markets you don&rsquo;t understand</b>: scammers often target new and inexperienced traders</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Be smart</b>: use resources like the ScamSmart page from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Never download software from an untrustworthy source</b>: the risks are just too great</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Always use the safest, mainstream banking methods</b>: certain financial transaction methods are safer than others</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Never, ever make investments after a few glasses of wine or bottles of beer</b>: your normal good judgment may be impaired!</p>\n<h2>Common Industries With A High Scam Risk</h2>\n<p>Some industries and market sectors seem to lend themselves to ripping people off. If you want to protect yourself from online scams, a good starting point is to be aware of which sectors are renowned for being high risk.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/4bb0cd69e5263411654a502d7ce3f579.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/4bb0cd69e5263411654a502d7ce3f579.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"329\"></picture></p>\n<p>At the highest level, the mining, real estate, construction, oil/gas, and banking sectors have all proved to be highly susceptible to online fraud. And at an individual level, the E-Commerce sector continues to be a minefield at times.</p>\n<p>Drilling down into the financial sector in specific, regrettably for any potential online investors, there are four investment areas that are especially open to fraud:</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/binary-options-scams/\">Binary Options</a></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/stock-trading-scams/\">Contracts for Difference (CFDs)</a></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/cryptocurrency-scams/\">Cryptocurrencies</a></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/forex-scams/\">Forex</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>However, the good news is that the majority of companies operating in these sectors are genuine, and if you do fall victim to a scam, there are some excellent chargeback companies that can often help to recoup your losses.</p>\n<h2>What To Look At When Investing Money Online</h2>\n<p>The old mantra, &ldquo;prevention is better than cure,&rdquo; is the best possible advice for protection against fraud. And the next best piece of advice is to walk away if you have any doubts or worries. There are always plenty of other investment opportunities for you, especially online.</p>\n<p>Before you even think of handing over any money and investing online, you should run through a simple checklist. Yes, this will take a little effort on your part, but if it prevents you from making a bad investment and being ripped off, it will be time well spent.</p>\n<p>For the best scam protection when investing money online, these are the sort of considerations to bear in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Is the company fully licensed and regulated?</b> If there&rsquo;s no mention of these crucial areas, walk away</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>How convincing are the online reviews?</b> Planted, fake reviews often have a phony, repetitive feel to them, and don&rsquo;t feature a picture of the reviewer</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>How real are the employees?</b> Check out social media applications like Linked-In to see if the employee and company have a genuine presence</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>How trustworthy is the company?</b> Do your research, and check out the opinions of leading newspapers, financial publications, respected brokers, and informed family members and colleagues</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>How are financial transactions handled, and how safe are they?</b> Remember that certain banking methods are safer, and have more back-ups and checks for protection against fraud.</p>\n<h2>Questions To Ask Before Making Final Investment Decisions Online</h2>\n<p>Making financial investments online is quick, easy, convenient&#8230; and very exciting! But that same convenience means you need to be doubly careful in order to protect yourself from online scams.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Most people are rightly cautious and sensible when it comes to making real-life, face to face investment decisions. But there can be a tendency for that usual caution, reason, and common sense to go out of the window when investing online. Here are some of the questions you need to ask yourself before making a final decision:</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/b440d121c71e67635cef2ab3f7132ab3.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/b440d121c71e67635cef2ab3f7132ab3.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"321\"></picture></p>\n<h6><strong>What Is The Company&rsquo;s Track Record Like?</strong></h6>\n<p>Online investments are no different from traditional investment methods. You wouldn&rsquo;t put money into a brick and mortar company without checking it out first. So make sure you do the same with any potential online investment.</p>\n<h6><strong>What Are The Risks And Rates Of Return?</strong></h6>\n<p>There&rsquo;s no such thing as a 100%, sure-fire, cast-iron investment, so don&rsquo;t get taken in by the hype. If something sounds too good to be true, it usually is.</p>\n<h6><strong>How Easy Is The Withdrawal Process?</strong></h6>\n<p>Some companies are exceptionally good at making it nigh on impossible for you to withdraw any profits. Better to check ahead of time than to be wise after the event.&nbsp;</p>\n<h6><strong>What About The Terms And Conditions?</strong></h6>\n<p>Thoroughly read and reread every contract. It&rsquo;s all too easy to be caught out by mean or underhand conditions buried in the small print. Get someone else to check the contract for you, and don&rsquo;t be afraid to question the company about any doubts you may have.</p>\n<p>Following this advice is the best way of protecting yourself from fraud. Every single investment decision comes with an element of risk, and online investments are no different. But by doing your homework, you can greatly reduce or even eliminate the chances of being ripped off.</p>\n",

If you&rsquo;re looking to make money in this way, chances are you&rsquo;ll be using a broker. For the most part, brokers are genuine and trustworthy.

Here are some of the most common tactics they use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">An irresistible opening offer, often exhorting you to act now or miss out</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Making a copy of a reputable company&rsquo;s website, and tricking you into thinking that you&rsquo;re working with a bona fide operator</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Targeting new and inexperienced traders</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Claiming to be something they&rsquo;re not (like falsely saying they&rsquo;re regulated)</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Making it very difficult or almost impossible for you to withdraw funds, in the hope that you might just give up in exasperation</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fraudulently taking funds from your account with no authorization</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some bogus brokers appear so genuine that it&rsquo;s hard not to get sucked in.

And in cases where you&rsquo;ve had a bad experience, remember that experts can advise you on how to get <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/\">money back after being scammed online</a>.</p>\n<h2>How To Get Money Back After Being Scammed Online</h2>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve been ripped off, how easy is it to get money back from a scammer? The answer is: &ldquo;it depends.&rdquo; In some situations, you might be surprised at how simple the process is. For a rogue charge on your credit card, for example, you can make a claim to your bank for an unauthorized transaction.</p>\n<p>However, other cases may prove to be more drawn-out, difficult, or even impossible to resolve, for example, if you used a wire service like Moneygram, PayPoint, or Western Union. For more complicated scenarios, your best bet is to use a professional funds recovery service.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/d30e14a9680cd7d74fa789768c0b0521.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/d30e14a9680cd7d74fa789768c0b0521.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"413\"></picture></p>\n<h2>The Process Of Funds Recovery</h2>\n<p>Companies involved in funds recovery typically have staff with long experience of working in the binary options, forex, legal or banking professions. To help recover your funds, they&rsquo;ll need copies of any relevant correspondence, confirmation of financial transactions, and details of the broker&rsquo;s offer and website.</p>\n<p>Some unscrupulous brokers are like bullies: they intimidate private individuals, but back down when confronted by expert professionals. Often, the simple threat of legal action is enough to shame the guilty party into action. In other cases, formal legal action may be required. The best funds recovery firms will only commence litigation where there&rsquo;s a strong case, and only charge a fee in the event of a successful outcome.</p>\n<h2>The Process Of Funds Recovery</h2>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a sad fact that some of the companies that promise to get your money back are in fact scammers themselves! So, how can you ensure that you choose a trustworthy company to help recover your money, instead of falling for another scam? Here are a few pointers:</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/9ea1b94ef5bb47a2346572450bf164a7.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/9ea1b94ef5bb47a2346572450bf164a7.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"297\"></picture></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Try word of mouth: ask your friends and family for advice, or failing that, look at recommendations online from a trusted source (check if the company is on Linked-In, for example)</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Always make sure the company has a safe, secure, and well-designed website, with a physical address and phone numbers</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Watch out for extravagant and unrealistic claims (no <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/a-guide-to-chargebacks-recover-your-funds-after-a-scam/\">chargeback</a> company can ever make a 100% promise of success!)</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Speak to a named person in the company, ask them some tough questions (about contracts and fees), then form your own view on their credentials.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve been a victim of cybercrime when trading binary options or forex, it&rsquo;s reassuring to learn that there are expert companies who can show you how to get money back. However, prevention is far better than cure, and the best way to avoid being ripped off is to take more care in the first place. Never forget the old adage that if something looks too good to be true, it generally is! But also never forget that if you&rsquo;ve been scammed online by the bad guys, there are good guys out there who can show you how to get your money back.</p>\n",

            "content": "<p>It is extremely important for investors to remain updated about the latest happenings in financial markets. Keeping track of emerging developments ultimately empowers smarter investment decision-making.</p>\n<p>At the same time, it is vital to acquire knowledge about past instances of fraud in order to learn from them. It is worth noting that <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/stock-trading-scams/\">stock scams</a> are among the most common frauds conducted in financial markets.</p>\n<p>Therefore, investors must keep a tab on these scams and ensure that they do not fall prey. Keep reading to take a closer look at the most prominent stock scams in history.</p>\n<h2>ENRON</h2>\n<p>One of the most prominent stock scams of all time involved energy trading company Enron. This company was once counted among the top energy sector brands in the US. It became fairly popular among investors in the late 1990s and the early 2000s. The company&rsquo;s stock was being traded at over $90 per share.</p>\n<p>However, during the year 2001, it was discovered that Enron was using shell companies and illegal accounting practices in order to hide large amounts of debt. This resulted in a sharp decline in the share prices, as they bottomed out to under $1. This was a major scam that led to massive wealth erosion for investors.</p>\n<h2>WORLDCOM</h2>\n<p>Another case that involved an accounting scandal involved telecommunication company WorldCom. The company recorded profits of $1.3 billion during the year 2001. It was one of the most well-known brands in the telecom industry. The company&rsquo;s price per share stood at $60. However, during the year 2002, it was revealed that WorldCom was reporting its operating expenses in the form of investments.</p>\n<p>This act of account manipulation led to a sharp fall in the share prices. After the scandal came under the public spotlight, WorldCom&rsquo;s share price fell to $0.20. This case not only rocked the company&rsquo;s investors but also resulted in massive job losses.</p>\n<h2>QWEST COMMUNICATIONS</h2>\n<p>During the late 1990s, Qwest Communications was among the largest telecom companies in the US. The company offered a range of services to its customers and was counted among the most recognizable brands within the telecom industry.</p>\n<p>In 1999, the CEO of the firm stated that it was targeting double-digit revenue growth over the next few years. However, the telecom market was quickly becoming saturated, making it hard for the company to achieve its targets.</p>\n<p>In order to cover up the situation, the company made use of fraudulent accounting and misleading financial instruments. This resulted in a huge decline in the company&rsquo;s share price, leading to investor losses of around $3 billion.</p>\n<h2>BERNARD MADOFF</h2>\n<p>Bernard Madoff Investment Securities was a company set up by Bernie Madoff. This company executed a complex scam that allowed it to hide its hedge fund losses. The firm adopted a technique that allowed it to raise money from one set of investors to pay off others known as a Ponzi scheme (named after Charles Ponzi).</p>\n<p>Even though the company was recording consistent gains over the years, it had only been siphoning off money from one source to pay another. This scam cost investors more than $50 billion.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The above cases indicate that stock market investing isn&rsquo;t without its risks. However, if investors pay enough attention to financial statements and don&rsquo;t fall for stories that are too good to be true, they can detect the warning signs. As always, the best strategy is to diversify your portfolio in order to minimize the risks.</p>\n",

            "content": "<p>The world is increasingly going cashless, and credit cards continue to be the leaders in payment processing due to their established infrastructure and massive networks. Indeed, with improvements in credit card technology and digital payments, credit card usage has been on the rise. The US Federal Reserve&rsquo;s triennial study on payment methods in the US found that transaction volumes increased from $103.5 billion in 2015 to $111.1 billion in 2016, or 10.2%, and those numbers have continued to increase.</p>\n<p>Even so, credit card fraud has seen parallel growth despite security improvements and stronger efforts to prevent it. A study conducted by RSA found that in the US alone, credit card transaction fraud costs merchants $508.00 per fraudulent transaction, with card-not-present (CNP) fraud showing significant growth in 2019. For merchants, this is a concerning issue, but not one that is without a solution.</p>\n<p>Although you can never fully eliminate the risk, you can certainly mitigate it, and you can protect yourself even in the worst of cases against legal action that could be costly and damage your reputation. Here are some of the top credit card fraud detection strategies you can implement to secure your payments:</p>\n<h2>CHECK USERS&rsquo; LOCATIONS WHEN THEY MAKE A PURCHASE</h2>\n<p>It&rsquo;s common that when users are committing credit card fraud, and especially CNP fraud, they are not usually doing so from the card&rsquo;s original location. This means that a simple check that matches a user&rsquo;s credit card billing address with an approximate location could reveal much about a transaction&rsquo;s origin. Geolocation tools, for instance, let you track an IP address&rsquo; approximate location to match against their provided billing address.</p>\n<p>Moreover, transactions from a single card from multiple locations in a short span may also be a red flag. Even so, it&rsquo;s worth remembering that while these are good indicators, there may also be legitimate reasons for information not matching up perfectly. A cardholder who&rsquo;s making a purchase from abroad may have a non-matching IP address, as would someone who holds a card from a foreign card issuer for business purposes.</p>\n<h2>KEEP DETAILED RECORDS OF DELIVERY AND FULFILMENT</h2>\n<p>One common strategy for fraudsters is to make purchases to wrong addresses or non-existing ones, and file <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/a-guide-to-chargebacks-recover-your-funds-after-a-scam/\">chargeback complaints with card processors</a>. For merchants, fighting these penalties and paying the fees can be damaging, but it&rsquo;s not impossible to combat. One way to do so is to focus on keeping detailed records of every part of a transaction, even after payment has been processed.</p>\n<p>Tracking records at each step, as well as signed proof of delivery documents, are crucial to combat any claim, as is information about order fulfilment. Make sure to maintain clear communication with your users at every step to build a clear record of your fulfilment process. Additionally, having fast delivery processes can help avoid even friendly fraud (when customers <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/a-guide-to-chargebacks-recover-your-funds-after-a-scam/\">request chargebacks</a> before attempting to obtain a refund from a merchant).</p>\n<h2>EMBRACE ANALYTICS AND DATA</h2>\n<p>One of the silver linings of CNP fraud is that it produces data. Whenever fraud occurs or fails in an attempt, you gain a wealth of knowledge about the attack and where it succeeded or went wrong. By itself, the data has limited value, but when you analyze and break it down, it can give you an excellent blueprint to help mitigate fraud in the future.</p>\n<p>Analytics suites can help you find patterns in transactions, as well as detect suspicious activity in real time based on historic trends. More importantly, it lets you understand your defenses, and gives you areas to improve your security. You can see which indicators were missed, which you succeeded in identifying, and integrate those into your detection models for the future.</p>\n<h2>IMPLEMENT AND MEET BEST SECURITY PRACTICES</h2>\n<p>Surprisingly, one of the most common causes of fraud is lax standards that miss major signs of trouble. This can range from forgetting to ask basic details to missing important information such as billing address for matching, and even double-checking credit card data against users&rsquo; accounts. In many of these cases, the result is not fraud, but in those where it is, merchants may be hard-pressed to reclaim anything, or be able to prove it happened.</p>\n<p>Following best industry practices isn&rsquo;t a guarantee that you&rsquo;ll completely avoid fraud, but it is a good way to mitigate your risk. Steps such as requiring users input their CVV (card verification code) can greatly reduce the opportunity for fraud. Similarly, asking for a phone number, double-checking returning users&rsquo; information, and installing multiple fraud detection tools are important steps in avoiding a pitfall for your online store.</p>\n<h2>HAVE CLEAR PROTOCOLS FOR SUSPECTED FRAUD</h2>\n<p>One of the big mistakes you can make when dealing with potential fraud is waiting until it becomes actual fraud. In many cases, waiting until the hammer drops means all that will be left is to pick up the pieces, not get your money back. To avoid this, it&rsquo;s important to understand that you don&rsquo;t have to wait to start protecting yourself against potential fraud, and that you should have clear steps in place to make sure you act early enough.</p>\n<p>The first step should be to contact your customer directly. If you suspect the card may be fraudulent, calling to verify a purchase to the number provided may be a great way to avoid it altogether. Delaying shipments, and even alerting your payment processor are other easy steps that can save you thousands of dollars and only provide minor inconveniences to your users.</p>\n<h2>PREVENT FRAUD</h2>\n<p>In the end, it&rsquo;s impossible to fully prevent fraud, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you shouldn&rsquo;t work to avoid it. By focusing on detecting it and heading it off before it becomes critical, you can fight fraud and mitigate your company&rsquo;s risk.</p>\n<p>For assistance with recovery funds after credit card fraud contact: <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/\">PayBack LTD Recovery Services</a></p>\n",

Mail servers block many of these messages, and you might see some of them land in your spam folder.</li>\n<li>Unfortunately, the payout promised by this type of scam almost never exists &#8211; and once you&rsquo;ve paid the scammer, recovering your money may be next to impossible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To avoid these types of nefarious schemes, simply ignore emails, phone calls or text messages asking you to make a payment in exchange for a large sum of money and send it to your junk folder or report them to the infrastructure provider.<br />\nAs with all scams, it&rsquo;s important to remember the golden rule: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</p>\n<h2>GUARANTEED ACCEPTANCE FOR A CREDIT CARD OR LOAN</h2>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve been trying unsuccessfully to obtain a credit card or personal loan, you&rsquo;ll know how frustrating rejected applications can be. So, what if there was a guaranteed way to get your card or loan? That&rsquo;s exactly what the guaranteed acceptance scam promises its victims.</p>\n<p>Unlike legitimate loan or credit card applications that require a solid credit and employment history and stable personal finances, guaranteed approval scams won&rsquo;t ask you for much financial information at all. That is the first sign that you&rsquo;re dealing with a less-than-honest organization.</p>\n<p>In exchange for guaranteed approval, you may be asked to pay an upfront fee, join a club, or take other actions that require you to pay the scammer immediately. As you may have guessed, once you&rsquo;ve paid the fee, that&rsquo;s probably the last you&rsquo;ll hear from the scammer. Moreover, your credit card or loan will never materialize.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This type of scam often targets job seekers, students and people with bad credit.</li>\n<li>You should be especially cautious about any offer you receive in the mail without your name on it, by email or in a text or social media message.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To avoid the guaranteed approval scam, it&rsquo;s important to remember that there&rsquo;s simply no such thing as credit approval without a hard credit check and detailed financial information.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re dealing with a legitimate loan or credit card company, they&rsquo;ll always ask you to verify your identity, income and credit record. Furthermore, it&rsquo;s important to not disclose sensitive or seemingly harmless personal information over the phone to someone who reaches you directly.</p>\n<h2>LOTTERY SCAMS</h2>\n<p>Winning the lottery is a dream that many people wish would come true. Accordingly, it&rsquo;s no wonder it&rsquo;s such a popular story for scammers to tell unsuspecting victims.</p>\n<p>If you read through your junk email folder right now, chances are you&rsquo;ll come across more than one lottery scam email that your email provider has already filtered for your safety. If you&rsquo;re unlucky, you may receive one in your regular inbox delivering the best news you&rsquo;ve had all year: you&rsquo;ve just won the UK, Spanish or another foreign lottery.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The lottery scam works by getting you excited over your big win and baiting you with a type of upfront fee that you need to pay in order to receive or unlock the funds.</li>\n<li>This fee could be in the form of &ldquo;government taxes&rdquo;, a processing or handling fee, or bank transfer fees.</li>\n<li>After paying the fee, you&rsquo;ll never hear from the scammer again and you certainly won&rsquo;t receive any lottery winnings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember, every lottery in the world requires you to buy a ticket in order to stand a chance of winning. If you haven&rsquo;t bought a lottery ticket, you simply can&rsquo;t be the winner. It&rsquo;s as simple as that.</p>\n<p>Another type of scam you may encounter are special offers to buy guaranteed winning numbers for local or international lotteries. Any time you hear &ldquo;guaranteed&rdquo; and &ldquo;lottery&rdquo; in the same sentence, you&rsquo;ll know there&rsquo;s a scammer at work.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;d like to stand the chance to win a lottery prize, simply buy lottery tickets the old-fashioned way or through your local lottery&rsquo;s official website. That way, you&rsquo;ll be sure you&rsquo;re not getting scammed.</p>\n<h2>PHISHING</h2>\n<p>The phishing scam is a sophisticated type of fraud which tricks you into revealing your banking login details or personal information to the scammer through a <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/12-easy-ways-to-check-if-a-website-is-legit-or-a-scam/\">fake website</a> and email address.</p>\n<p>Typically, you&rsquo;ll receive an email that looks like it was sent by your bank, online broker or PayPal.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The mail will scare you by telling you that your account security has been compromised and that you need to update your details immediately.</li>\n<li>Once you click on the link in the email, you&rsquo;ll be directed to a fake website that appears to look similar to the official company website the scammer is impersonating.</li>\n<li>After you enter your details, the scammer will use them to access your real account drain every last cent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that your bank, broker or PayPal will never email you asking you to confirm your account details.</p>\n<p>If you do receive an email that looks suspicious, first make sure that it has been sent from the organization&rsquo;s official email address. Then give them a call to confirm that it was really sent from a legitimate person.</p>\n<p>To report identity theft in the US, you can visit the federal government&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.identitytheft.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">identitytheft.org website</a>.</p>\n<h2>OVERPAYMENT SCAM</h2>\n<p>If you run an online store or have recently posted items for sale on a classifieds site like Craigslist, you will want to watch out for the overpayment scam.</p>\n<p>This scam is especially easy to fall for because the scammer will actually send you money first before trying to defraud you. Here&rsquo;s how it works:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You&rsquo;ll receive a message from the scammer, to say they paid you too much for the product by mistake and asking you to refund them the difference.</li>\n<li>They&rsquo;ll typically ask you to make payment by Western Union, MoneyGram or another payment method that&rsquo;s difficult to trace.</li>\n<li>After you make the payment, you&rsquo;ll realize that their original payment is fake &#8211; either the proof of payment they sent is forged or the payment will have been reversed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you sell your items on eBay or Amazon remember that it&rsquo;s almost impossible for someone to overpay you on these sites. The exact amount due is charged on the checkout page, so if a buyer claims to have overpaid, you should absolutely be suspicious of the supposed &ldquo;buyer&rdquo;.</p>\n<h2>CAREER OPPORTUNITIES</h2>\n<p>Job seekers are always keen to find employment opportunities and scammers often take advantage of this reality.</p>\n<p>If you receive an email from someone you&rsquo;ve never heard of, offering you access to a great selection of jobs with high salaries in exchange for a fee, be on your guard.</p>\n<p>You should also be suspicious of jobs that require very few skills &#8211; like putting letters in envelopes or assembling low quality products.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The career opportunities scam almost always requires you to pay an upfront fee. This is typical of most scams.</li>\n<li>It could be called a finders&rsquo; fee, job placement fee or membership fees for a job seeker&rsquo;s club, or the cost of training materials or a home assembly kit.</li>\n<li>Once you&rsquo;ve paid the fee, you&rsquo;ll soon realize that the jobs on offer either don&rsquo;t exist or the positions have already been filled.</li>\n<li>If the scam involves assembling products, you&rsquo;ll find that nobody wants to buy them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remember, when companies use employment agencies to recruit talent, the recruitment fees are almost always paid by the company &#8211; not by you. Any time you&rsquo;re asked to pay upfront, you should be especially cautious.</p>\n<h2>CHARITABLE DONATIONS</h2>\n<p>The spirit of giving is a beautiful part of human nature, and millions of people are in need of benefit from charitable donations each year.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, scammers are extremely active in the online charity space. Accordingly, you&rsquo;ll always want to verify before you donate.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you receive an email asking for charitable donations, check the name of the charity carefully. It could be a scam.</li>\n<li>You can check the legitimacy of a charity through give.org, the Better Business Bureau&rsquo;s Wise Giving website. Simply enter the name of the charity to find out if it&rsquo;s a scam or not.</li>\n<li>Be especially careful of emails that feature &ldquo;tearjerker&rdquo; stories about poor children or families in developing countries and ask you to donate to anonymous persons.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To ensure that your charitable donations reach people who are truly in need, it&rsquo;s best to donate to well-known charities with long track records of transparently supporting successful projects.</p>\n<h2>FREE VACATIONS</h2>\n<p>Everyone loves a relaxing vacation and getting one for free sounds like a dream come true. Unfortunately, chances are that an offer like this could be a scam.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The free vacation scam always starts by giving you exciting news &#8211; you&rsquo;ve won a free trip! However, to claim it, you&rsquo;ll need to join a club or pay a fee.</li>\n<li>Once you&rsquo;ve paid, not only will you never receive the free trip, but you&rsquo;ll also have given your credit card information to the scammer which could result in serious financial harm.</li>\n<li>In the rare case where the scam does provide a free trip, it will usually involve extra fees, cheap flights and substandard accommodation &#8211; you could even arrive at your hotel only to find that your reservation was fake or cancelled at the last minute.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you&rsquo;d like a chance to win a free vacation, the best strategy is to enter a competition hosted by a well-known airline, booking site or tourism business. It&rsquo;s always better to be safe than sorry.</p>\n<h2>MAKE MONEY AT HOME USING YOUR COMPUTER SCHEMES</h2>\n<p>The final scam is probably the sneakiest of all. In this age of freelance work and remote jobs, there&rsquo;s nothing unusual about making money at home using a computer.<br />\nScammers are taking advantage of this to hide their fraudulent schemes in plain sight.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The work from home scam usually involves something like posting reviews on unknown websites, sending out mass emails to unknown people, or other simple tasks.</li>\n<li>You&rsquo;ll be promised big earnings &#8211; usually thousands of dollars per month &#8211; for doing menial tasks. This is a big red flag.</li>\n<li>Almost all of these scams will ask you to pay a signup fee or a training fee before you start working. Once you&rsquo;ve paid this, you&rsquo;ll realize that your earnings are tiny or nonexistent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To avoid being scammed like this, it&rsquo;s best to always seek online work through legitimate companies or freelance sites.</p>\n<h2>STAY SAFE, STAY LEGITIMATE, AND NEVER PAY UPFRONT</h2>\n<p>Online scams are always evolving, but they always feature common traits; an offer that&rsquo;s too good to be true, a time limit that&rsquo;s going to expire soon, and an upfront payment.<br />\nBy avoiding online offers that exhibit these characteristics and sticking to well-known websites and organizations, you&rsquo;ll be able to stay safe online and enjoy the great entertainment and career opportunities that the internet and social media have to offer.</p>\n",

            "content": "<p>From the first few cases reported in China towards the end of 2019, coronavirus is now starting to hit the headlines all round the world. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">World Health Organization</a>&nbsp;is looking on nervously and hopes to help contain the spread of the illness until a vaccine can be developed. Meanwhile, new cases are reported almost daily with more and more countries being affected.</p>\n<p>But what is being less reported is the spread of another contagion linked with the virus &ndash; that of scammers who are hoping to exploit the global panic for their own illegal gains. So it&rsquo;s as well to be aware of what forms these scams are taking, and how you can take steps to avoid being a victim.</p>\n<h2>SINKING THE PHISHING SCAMS</h2>\n<p>In the current climate, people are eager to learn as much as they possibly can about the virus, its symptoms and, most importantly, how to avoid contracting it. Some scammers are trying to exploit this fact by sending emails that appear to be from an official source containing links to articles with relevant information. In fact, they will take you to malicious websites set up to steal identity and financial information and possibly even infect your computer with a virus or other malware. So beware of any emails unless you can be 100% sure that they are genuine.</p>\n<h2>RESISTING THE RETAIL SCAMS</h2>\n<p>Ever since the news of the virus started to spread there has been a sudden increase in demand for hygiene products like face masks and hand sanitizer. This, in turn, has led to many&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/masks-run-short-as-coronavirus-spreads-11582829321\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pharmacies and medical supply companies running out of stock</a>.<br />\nThis has presented a golden opportunity for scammers to set up a number of fake websites. In some cases they are selling face masks that fail to meet approved quality standards, in others they are simply taking payment and never supplying the goods.<br />\nSigns that a website might not be as genuine as it first appears to be include having many links to it on social media, being littered with spelling and grammar mistakes and simply not looking or feeling &ldquo;quite right&rdquo;.</p>\n<h2>IMMUNIZING YOURSELF FROM CORONAVIRUS SCAMS</h2>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a sad reflection of the world today that criminals will take a terrible situation like the coronavirus outbreak and try to use it to exploit the public. But, unfortunately, this is exactly what they&rsquo;re doing. But don&rsquo;t worry. There&rsquo;s plenty we can do to stop them.</p>\n<h3>Handling Phishing Attempts</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first thing to look at is the address of the sender. If it looks suspect in any way, delete the email immediately.</li>\n<li>If there are any links in the email be very cautious about following them unless you can be 100% sure that the sender is genuine.</li>\n<li>Scammers use a very particular form of sensationalist language to instil a sense of urgency and panic. So watch out for words like &ldquo;exclusive&rdquo;, &ldquo;danger&rdquo; and &ldquo;shocking&rdquo;. Spot any of these, or similar words, and you need to be on your guard.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Avoiding Retail Scams</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>All legitimate retailers should have a physical address that they publish on their website. If you can&rsquo;t find one, it&rsquo;s probably a hoax.</li>\n<li>If you do buy, use a credit card as this includes financial&nbsp;<a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/\">protection against scammers</a>.</li>\n<li>Get an idea of what most retailers are charging for the products in question. High prices suggest it might not be legitimate.</li>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t go to online marketplaces like eBay and Craigslist &ndash; buy direct from trusted retailers instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fear and panic are the two things many scammers rely on to persuade people they are genuine. But, armed with the advice you&rsquo;ve received here, you should be able to make rational, sensible decisions that will keep you safe.</p>\n",

            "content": "<h2>What is a pyramid scheme?</h2>\n<p>Every few years, the news headlines start buzzing with stories about investors losing money in the latest pyramid scheme. A pyramid scheme is a financial scam that looks totally legitimate at first glance but in fact isn&rsquo;t. Knowing what they are is the first step to avoiding them.</p>\n<p>Most of these schemes are based on investments and recruiting salespeople with promises of excellent returns or earnings. However, in reality, initial investors are the only ones who make any money while those who join later usually end up losing their investments.</p>\n<p>Read on to find out exactly how pyramid schemes work, what types of schemes are out there, and how you can avoid becoming the next victim.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/c5cbeb012dd91e5588dcda16072751be.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/c5cbeb012dd91e5588dcda16072751be.jpg\" width=\"584\" height=\"829\"></picture></p>\n<h2>How does a pyramid scheme work?</h2>\n<p>Pyramid schemes get their name from the distribution of earnings that take place between their members. Most of the funds in the scheme go to the initial investors at the top, while subsequent investors end up funding the scheme, eventually getting little or nothing out of it.</p>\n<p>Instead of investing their members&rsquo; funds responsibly or providing them with products that really sell, pyramid schemes simply take the initial signup fees paid by new members, pay them a few good investment returns or sales commissions to keep them happy, and then move on to the next member.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The initial fees paid by new members are used to pay commissions to existing members, with members who refer newcomers receiving commissions on the fees they pay.</li>\n<li>This continues all the way down the chain of referrals, with the original members taking a commission on every member who joined after them.</li>\n<li>You could say that pyramid schemes operate on a &ldquo;rob Peter to pay Paul&rdquo; model, because the only source of income the scheme has is initial fees paid by new members.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The fraudulent side of pyramid schemes is that you&rsquo;ll never know this is the case: the scheme will always claim to generate its income from investments or product sales.</p>\n<p>Eventually, the income from new members runs out or is insufficient to pay commissions to other members and the scheme collapses. At this stage, every member loses the money they invested in the scheme and the founders, if arrested, face criminal charges.</p>\n<h2>4 different types of pyramid schemes:</h2>\n<p>Pyramid schemes come in different varieties, but they all operate in roughly the same manner. The most common types of pyramid schemes perpetrated by scammers are discussed in more detail below.</p>\n<p>If you are curious about investing in Forex, read more in &#8220;<a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/is-forex-a-pyramid-scheme-what-to-look-for/\">Is forex a pyramid scheme?</a>&#8220;</p>\n<h3>1. Multi-Level Marketing Pyramid Scheme</h3>\n<p>Almost everyone is familiar with successful multi-level marketing businesses like Amway and Herbalife. These companies encourage their distributors to recruit and train new salespeople and let them earn a commission both from their own sales and the sales of the distributors in their networks.</p>\n<p>While legitimate multi-level marketing businesses are perfectly legal because they sell real, useful products and services, multi-level pyramid schemes are fraudulent because they derive all their income from signup fees.</p>\n<p>If you receive a letter, email or other message inviting you to join a multi-level marketing company that offers large financial rewards but low-quality products, it should automatically be a red flag.</p>\n<p>Multi-level marketing schemes will always emphasize recruitment of new members over sales. In fact, some schemes may not even bother to send you anything to sell at all.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re simply recruiting new members to take a commission from their signup fees, you&rsquo;ve not only been lured into a pyramid scheme, you&rsquo;re actively promoting it. It&rsquo;s best to avoid these types of schemes altogether.</p>\n<h3>2. Chain Emails</h3>\n<p>A primitive but tricky type of pyramid scheme is the chain email and you may have been the unwitting recipient of these messages in the past.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This type of scheme started out as chain letters and they have been around for centuries.</li>\n<li>The email will promise you a large sum of money if you remove the name at the top of the chain, replace it with your name and send it to a certain number of people.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You&rsquo;ll also be asked to send a small amount of money (typically $10 or less) to the person who sent it to you.</p>\n<p>While chain emails may sound silly or as easy to detect as scams, a surprising number of people are taken in by them. Typically, after paying the person who sent you the letter, you&rsquo;ll send it on to a number of people and receive nothing from them. After all, they&rsquo;re free to delete it and never send you a cent.</p>\n<p>As with all the pyramid schemes on the list, it&rsquo;s best to simply ignore chain emails and move along.</p>\n<h3>3. Ponzi Schemes</h3>\n<p>Just as multi-level marketing schemes mislead new members by posing as direct sales companies, Ponzi schemes present themselves as investment companies. People around the world have lost millions &#8211; in fact, billions &#8211; of dollars through these schemes.</p>\n<p>Ponzi schemes can appear to be legitimate investment funds at first glance. In fact, the famous case of Bernie Madoff who used his licensed investment fund to defraud clients of $65 billion over 20 years shows just how convincing they can be.</p>\n<p>Named after Charles Ponzi, who was jailed for defrauding the public of $7 million back in the 1920s, the Ponzi scheme targets investors who are always keen for higher-than-average returns.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Investors are promised market-beating returns on their investments, and usually receive a few generous payments at first to convince them to invest more.</li>\n<li>The scheme will usually try to minimize the number of payouts it needs to make by offering a higher return in exchange for long-term investment lockup periods.</li>\n<li>Investors may receive trading updates, quarterly and annual reports, and other financial documents that generate an impression of legitimacy and cause them to drop their guard.</li>\n<li>Eventually, the scheme will run out of funds to pay returns to its investors and it will collapse.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unlike chain emails and marketing schemes, Ponzi schemes may appear extremely legitimate to the untrained eye. In fact, some financial experts have been taken in by the more sophisticated Ponzi schemes.</p>\n<p>While higher returns in exchange for one or two-year fixed investments may be a red flag, this is also a common practice in the financial industry.</p>\n<p>In general, the best way to avoid joining a Ponzi scheme is to work with reputable brokers and banks that issue regular audit reports while resisting the urge to invest in something that looks too good to be true.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/blacklisted-brands/\">Unlicensed brokers</a>, small firms that have a fly-by-night attitude about them, and brokers which sell their investment products door-to-door are definitely worthy of suspicion and skepticism, especially if they promise or guarantee returns.</p>\n<h3>4. Money Multiplier Schemes</h3>\n<p>With the advent of social media there is a new generation of pyramid schemes making the rounds. One of the most famous examples was the Loom Circle scheme, which promised to pay its members 8 times the amount they had invested.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Online pyramid schemes are especially tricky because they often incentivize their members to post positive reviews on social media and review websites.</li>\n<li>This gives internet users the impression that the scheme is legitimate in its early stages.</li>\n<li>After a while, as members fail to receive their payouts, the scheme will gain an online reputation for being a scam &#8211; but it&rsquo;s too late by then for members who have already paid in.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How to spot a pyramid scheme?</h2>\n<p>All pyramid schemes have several things in common that set them apart as scams. If you encounter a scheme that fits this description, you have every reason to be suspicious:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It promises a large reward, unusually high returns on investment, or &ldquo;easy money&rdquo;.</li>\n<li>The focus is on recruiting new members instead of legitimate income generation.</li>\n<li>The company is unknown, unlicensed, and doesn&rsquo;t have a physical address.</li>\n<li>You are not required to have any particular skills or knowledge in order to earn the large income promised by the scheme.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, the age-old advice applies: if it&rsquo;s too good to be true, it probably is. Pyramid schemes sound great on paper, but they are one of the fastest ways to lose money.</p>\n<h2>All pyramid schemes will collapse in the end</h2>\n<p>One of the sneakiest aspects of pyramid schemes is that they usually pay dividends or income at the beginning to lure in new members. This makes them seem totally legitimate and may even encourage you to invest more in the scheme.</p>\n<p>In the end, however, all pyramid schemes collapse. The more you have invested, the more you stand to lose.</p>\n<p>To avoid becoming a victim of a pyramid scheme, try to always have reasonable expectations. A high income is the result of hard work and in-demand skills, and market-beating investment returns are the exception, not the rule.</p>\n<p>By sticking to legitimate businesses, employers and investment brokers, you&rsquo;ll limit your exposure to pyramid schemes and keep your hard-earned money safe from falling prey to devious scammers.</p>\n<p>If you lost money in a pyramid scheme contact a <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/\">fund recovery specialist</a> today!</p>\n",

            "content": "<p>The American real estate sector bears witness to the sale of over 5.96 million homes every year, out of which 63% are financed by a mortgage. While mortgages were intended to be an opportunity for aspiring homeowners, it has also become a thriving opening for enterprising scammers.</p>\n<p>A mortgage is always taken against a property. When you default on paying the monthly installment, the lender acquires the right to foreclosure, or more plainly, the right to seize (and sell) your property.</p>\n<p>Scammers often reach out to desperate homeowners who are contemplating ways to avoid foreclosure. Usually, these fake &ldquo;attorneys&rdquo; or &ldquo;property consultants&rdquo; would demand anything between $1,000 to $5,000. In one such scam, a company that went by the name of Shmuckler Group stole approximately $2.8 million from desperate borrowers.</p>\n<p>To help you avoid these types of losses, here is everything you need to know about mortgage scams, how to identify them, and the measures you can legally take to avoid foreclosure.</p>\n<h2>KNOW YOUR RIGHTS TO KEEP AWAY FROM SCAMS</h2>\n<p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), America&rsquo;s consumer protection agency, has a rule in place called the &ldquo;Mortgage Assistance Relief Services Rule&rdquo;. This rule makes it illegal for any company to ask for payment until a borrower has received some form of relief from the service. This means that you only pay for a service after the job you are paying for is done.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the rule requires all the companies to disclose whether they are associated with the Government. They are also bound to tell you that your lender may not agree to waive off your loan despite the services.</p>\n<p>These consultancies or legal firms should also warn you about the consequences of not paying the mortgage directly to the lender, a huge disadvantage being this could damage your credit score. Under no circumstances would they ask you to stop talking to your lender or lawyer.</p>\n<p>If you find any of these rules being violated, it is a sure-shot scam. Keep reading to familiarize yourself with the most common mortgage relief scams.</p>\n<h2>1. COUNSELING ON THE PHONE OR HELPING ANONYMOUSLY</h2>\n<p>A scammer claims that they could help you negotiate with your mortgage lender in this particular con. They may even promise to rescue you from foreclosure. However, they will always insist you do not discuss this conversation with your lender or loan counselor.</p>\n<p>Once you pay them their fees, they&#8217;ll simply stop taking your calls.</p>\n<p>Some scammers might ask you to deposit a reduced mortgage payment into an account. They assure you that the payment will be redirected to the lender, but that never happens.</p>\n<h2>2. FORENSIC AUDIT</h2>\n<p>This is one of the more sophisticated cons whereby the scammer claims to be a mortgage or foreclosure prevention auditor. They offer to scrutinize your mortgage papers for illegalities. They also offer to lower the mortgage amount or even cancel it.</p>\n<h2>3. RENT-TO-BUY SCHEMES</h2>\n<p>In this common con, a scammer will ask you to transfer the property to their name, while they allow you to continue your stay as a tenant. They assure you that you can always buy the property back whenever you&rsquo;re ready.</p>\n<p>However, if you transfer your property to the scammer, they can always ask you to vacate the house. They may even sell the property to someone else, thus, rendering all your previous installments futile.</p>\n<h2>4. BAIT AND SWITCH</h2>\n<p>As the name suggests, the perpetrators bait you into signing &ldquo;legal papers&rdquo;. From a quick glance, the papers seem to be about waving the mortgage off. However, amidst the bulk of these papers, the fraudsters sneak in a transfer deed for your property. With your signature on that paper, you have lost your house without even realizing it.</p>\n<h2>LEGAL METHODS TO GET NAVIGATE FORECLOSURE</h2>\n<p>If you are ever the recipient of a foreclosure notice for your property, the first step is always to speak to the lender. In certain cases, there might be a way to negotiate through these situations. You could also seek help from the housing counseling agencies approved by the US Government. Apart from these steps, there are other options you can explore when navigating foreclosure:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Apply for Bankruptcy:&nbsp;</strong>This is the easiest way to stay the execution of foreclosure. This will stop the bank from selling your property immediately for debt recovery.</li>\n<li><strong>Apply for Loan Modification:</strong>&nbsp;Change the way you pay the loan. When you apply for loan modification, the bank is barred from foreclosing your property. This is because of the pending loss mitigation. Loss mitigation is a process whereby the lender and borrower work together to prevent foreclosure.</li>\n<li><strong>Mortgage Forbearance Agreement:</strong>&nbsp;Upon signing this agreement, you will get the leverage to pay the loan back when your financial situation improves.</li>\n<li><strong>Refinance Your Mortgage:&nbsp;</strong>When you refinance your loan, you will only have to pay a closing cost and fees for a new mortgage and might even be able to get a better interest rate and lower monthly payment.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h2>\n<p>Scammers prey on desperate borrowers and those facing foreclosure are especially vulnerable. Instead of being conned out of your home, ensure that you take all the proper steps towards avoiding these vultures.</p>\n<p>Always speak directly with the lender, or government-approved groups to navigate the foreclosure process and uncover potential solutions to avoid falling prey to these scammers.</p>\n",

            "content": "<p>Thousands of money transfers happen every day. However, sometimes the recipient isn&rsquo;t a trusted friend or family. It could also be a scammer. According to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Federal Trade Commission</a>, there were over 3 million money transfer scams in 2018 alone.</p>\n<p>While money transfers can help you rescue people financially, they have also become a hot spot for theft and fraud. Money transfer scams are common because the process works fast. By the time you understand the scam, it&rsquo;s too late to recover the money.</p>\n<p>To help you steer clear of risks, keep reading to familiarize yourself with the most common money transfer scams.</p>\n<h2>FAKE BUYERS&rsquo; SCAMS</h2>\n<p>Scammers scan through various classified ads on the internet and newspapers and get in touch with you as interested buyers. In most cases, they do not bargain and send you a check for more than the asking price.</p>\n<p>Then they ask you to wire the extra amount to a third-party account. It is only after you transfer the money you realize that you put a fake check in your bank.<strong>&nbsp;In 2018, Americans lost $3.7 million to fake check scams</strong>.</p>\n<p>How to avoid the scam:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Try to only make a deal in person with a local buyer</li>\n<li>Do not accept checks of excessive amounts</li>\n<li>You could ask them to cancel this check and write a new one for the exact amount</li>\n<li>In case you need to send any refund, only make the transfers after your bank clears the check</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>FAKE SELLERS&rsquo; SCAMS</h2>\n<p>Cheaters advertise high-end items such as cars, designer products and imported goods at attractive prices online. Upon enquiring, you may find the offer authentic. However, they will ask you to wire transfer the money in advance.</p>\n<p>They would mitigate any other payment options and confirm your order only upon receipt of the payment. However, after the payment is done, you are blocked. These shop-at-home scams caused a total loss of $2.1 million in 2018.</p>\n<p><strong>Remember:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buy from local and trustworthy sellers</li>\n<li>Go for check or cash on delivery payments</li>\n<li>Refuse to wire money if they insist</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>FRAUDULENT PRIZES, LOTTERIES, AND SWEEPSTAKES</h2>\n<p>You may think you have hit the jackpot, but this could be yet another trap. A mystery prize is not always a pleasant surprise, especially if it comes with an exorbitant processing fee and random taxes.</p>\n<p>These scammers may reach out via a phone call or a mail. Most of the calls have a foreign country code. If the email or the letter you have received has way too many typos, be assured it wasn&rsquo;t written by a professional or legal authority.</p>\n<p><strong>Remember:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Never transfer money to anyone who sends you a letter or an email regarding a lottery or game you never even applied for</li>\n<li>Even if you have applied, it is always best to check the credentials and ask for documented proofs</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>A DISTRESSED RELATIVE</h2>\n<p>A frantic phone call, social media message, or email where a relative requests financial help by wire transfer is another common scam trick. They might tell you that they are sick or have been arrested in a foreign country. In 2017, Americans lost $328 million to such scams whereby swindlers tricked them by pretending to be a loved one in trouble.</p>\n<p><strong>Remember:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Call and confirm with your relative to verify any story</li>\n<li>Ask other relatives if they have received any such information</li>\n<li>If no one can validate the story, do not send any money</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>ADVANCE-FEE LOANS</h2>\n<p>Without considering your credit history, scammers offer loans and credit cards with significant benefits. There is only one condition they put forth: &nbsp;you must wire transfer the loan processing fee. This scam is perhaps the most dangerous of them all because they will not stop at looting your money once. They pose a future threat given they have your bank account details.</p>\n<p><strong>Remember:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Always double check the loan offers with your regular bank</li>\n<li>Take note: all such fees are paid after the loan proceedings and not in advance</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>MYSTERY SHOPPING JOBS</h2>\n<p>Luxury brands often hire secret shoppers and give them products to review. Scammers try and replicate the format but in fake mystery shopping jobs where you would be required to pay a registration fee through a bogus webpage via money transfer. &nbsp;Later they may even ask you to pay for the products from your own account.</p>\n<p><strong>Remember:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Never accept a mystery shopping job that requires a registration fee</li>\n<li>Don&rsquo;t accept a position where you pay for goods from your own bank account</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>FUND TRANSFER SCAMS FROM NIGERIA</h2>\n<p>A Nigerian royal family member is in great distress and needs YOUR help. Over the past three years, Nigerian letter-style scams have cost victims an average of $2,133.</p>\n<p><strong>Remember:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The very format of this letter is a sham and should be ignored</li>\n<li>Never send money or personal information to a stranger, no matter how good the offer</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>THE MTCN NUMBER</h2>\n<p>You have initiated a transfer to send money back at home. However, you receive a call from &ldquo;your bank&rdquo; or &ldquo;the wire transfer provider&rdquo;, and they need your MTCN to confirm the transaction. The Money Transfer Control Number (MTCN) is a unique code assigned to every transaction that occurs. If a scammer gets ahold of the MTCN, they could hijack the loop and steal the cash.</p>\n<p><strong>Remember:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>No bank or institution would ever ask for sensitive information on a haste call</li>\n<li>Never share personal information or passwords to anyone on your phone, chat, or emails</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h2>\n<p>Transferring money is normally a quick and reliable operation, just make sure you never wire transfer any money to strangers. If you anything about a process doesn&rsquo;t feel quite right, stop and do your research.</p>\n<p>Whether going online for more information or talking to an expert, take the steps to thwart an enterprising scammer trying to part you from your hard-earned money.</p>\n",

            "content": "<p>According to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Internal Revenue Service</a>, approximately 150 million Americans file their taxes every year. While this may sound like an impressive figure, the IRS also confirms that the American economy ends up losing over $1.8 billion to con artists and scammers every filing season.</p>\n<p>These thieves have a plethora of tricks in their arsenal. However, staying aware and vigilant could help you steer clear of losses this tax season and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/\">keep your money safe online</a>.</p>\n<h2>HOW TO STAY SAFE DURING THIS TAX SEASON</h2>\n<p>To help you safeguard your interests and hard-earned money, carefully examine a list of 4 of the most common tax scams. Here is everything you need to know to identify and stop them.</p>\n<h2>IRS PHONE SCAM</h2>\n<p>This is perhaps the most common and the oldest of all money-related cons in the US. The scammer poses as a representative of the Internal Revenue Service and calls you asking for instant payment. They use coercive threats and intimidation techniques to manipulate you into thinking that if you don&rsquo;t pay them right away, you may end up in legal trouble.</p>\n<p>What makes their act so convincing is that most of the times these scammers have access to a phone number that matches the IRS&rsquo; helpline closely. The loss due to such fraud calls has been calculated up to a total of $72 million annually.</p>\n<p><strong>How to stay safe:</strong>&nbsp;No IRS officer will ever make a phone call demanding payment. Also, the government would never ask for payments through a wire transfer or gift cards. If the person claiming to be an IRS officer is abusive or threatening, that is a clear tell-tale sign you are dealing with a con artist. The IRS or any other substitute government body has a set of procedures to conduct tax collection, and a hasty or aggressive phone call isn&rsquo;t part of the protocol.</p>\n<h2>FAKE TAX FORM SCAMS</h2>\n<p>An extension of the IRS phone con, the scammer would request your personal information along with your Social Security number (SSN). They claim that this data will be used to fill a fake tax form. These criminals can later use your data for illegal activities. Nearly 147 million people&rsquo;s private data was leaked through Equifax in 2017, which is testament to the lurking danger.</p>\n<p>Additionally, a mutation of these cons has emerged which is known as the&nbsp;<strong>Refund Bait-and-Switch Scam</strong>. Here, scammers will use your personal information to file a false tax return. When the return credits into your account, they will later call you to make a penalty-payment for an &lsquo;illegally obtained fund&rsquo; reflecting in your account. The scammer will pretend to be an agent of the IRS and ask for the money to be delivered to a place or deposited into an account.</p>\n<p><strong>How to be safe:</strong>&nbsp;Never give your sensitive information away, especially to someone who calls you first. Ask for the person&rsquo;s credentials before entertaining their requests. You should directly make a phone call to the IRS department in case you receive an ultimatum. You should also beware that the IRS would never raise sudden notices without fair warnings. Even if there is a case of account inconsistencies, the IRS would first send out formal letters for a regular amount of time. If all those letters go unanswered, you may be summoned to a local branch.</p>\n<h2>SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER SCAM</h2>\n<p>You may receive a call regarding your Social Security number. The caller would warn that your Social Security number will be frozen immediately, unless you pay your pending taxes right away. The common identifying sign of a scammer is they are always rushing you into payment. The government doesn&rsquo;t just randomly cancel or suspend your SSN. Even if the person calling you has your details, be assured that these callers want to dupe you.</p>\n<p><strong>How to be safe:</strong>&nbsp;The government will not unnecessarily cancel or freeze your SSN. So, if the call is regarding an unexpected legal action, hang up; it&rsquo;s most likely a fraud call.</p>\n<p>You should also immediately report the incident to the police or the government.</p>\n<h2>TAX PHISHING SCAM</h2>\n<p>These sophisticated scams have come a long way from sending out fear-inducing mails to directly reaching out over social media. These messages look authentic and replicate the formal tone used by government offices. They may push you towards giving your credit card details or sensitive information.</p>\n<p><strong>How to be safe:&nbsp;</strong>Beware! No government department, including the IRS will ever text you asking for personal details. They will definitely not reach out to you through social media. Therefore, any text asking for the same should raise red flags in your mind.</p>\n<h2>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h2>\n<p>Even though the text messages and calls look authentic, they are not. You should always be cautious of any unprecedented money that shows up in your account. If you find an unverifiable or unexpected transaction reflecting in your account, it is best to contact your accountant or local tax body.</p>\n<p>If government authorities decide to take action, there are legal procedures in place designed to protect taxpayer rights. Their channels of reaching out may be the same as that of a criminal seeking your funds or access to your personal details. They may call or mail you regarding the discrepancies.</p>\n<p>However, under no circumstance, does the government request confidential details over the phone, nor will they demand impromptu action. You may be called for a visit to the nearest IRS branch to act upon it, but the authenticity of the address can easily be verified by calling the national helpline for IRS.</p>\n",

            "content": "<p>The rising influence of technology has simplified the lives of people in many ways. However, it has also made personal data vulnerable and prone to attacks by hackers. In this digital age, when large amounts of personal and financial data is hosted online, it becomes important to keep it secure.</p>\n<p>If you haven&rsquo;t already, follow these 10 rules to secure your identity and keep your money safe.</p>\n<h2>1. KEEP YOUR DEVICES LOCKED</h2>\n<p>Whether it&rsquo;s your smartphone or laptop, your devices contain valuable personal information including bank account details and more. In almost every case, the password to all the accounts would be automatically saved.</p>\n<p>Keeping your devices secured and locked at all times is the only way to keep your information secured. It might be tedious to insert the password each time, but this process is a primary defense against potential intruders.</p>\n<h2>2. BE CAREFUL WHEN USING WI-FI</h2>\n<p>Whenever you&rsquo;re connected online through a public network, it&rsquo;s best to avoid accessing personal information. Bank transactions are a strict no-no, as it can expose your sensitive information to hackers.</p>\n<p>Public networks at places like malls, hotels, and coffee shops are soft targets for hackers. Though most apps and websites have secure platforms, it&rsquo;s not worth the risk.</p>\n<h2>3. NEVER USE THE SAME PASSWORD FOR ALL ACCOUNTS</h2>\n<p>It might be tempting to use the same password in all accounts for the ease of remembering. However, doing so will only land you in trouble in the event one of your accounts is hacked.</p>\n<p>Be creative when it comes to your passwords and have complex ones, especially for your bank accounts. Make good use of numbers and symbols besides letters to make sure your passwords are long enough.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, you do not have to remember them all given you can now make use of popular password managers like LastPass, which is available on Windows, Android, and iOS platforms.</p>\n<h2>4. USE TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION</h2>\n<p>Even if you have strong passwords, it might not be enough to prevent attempts designed to steal your personal information.</p>\n<p>Two-factor authentication is an added layer of security that can keep your accounts safe. Authenticator applications like Google Authenticator can be a great tool to start with.</p>\n<h2>5. DIGITALLY SHRED PRIVATE DOCUMENTS</h2>\n<p>Your old documents, if left unattended or misplaced, could cost you severely. You can never expect who can access your documents.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, it&rsquo;s best to trash them or better yet, even digitally shred them. Getting rid of documents that are no longer in need is the best way of staying organized.</p>\n<h2>6. USE ANTIVIRUS PROTECTION</h2>\n<p>There are numerous antivirus software solutions that provide protection against different online threats. Most of them don&rsquo;t cost much and provide quarterly, half-yearly or even annual protection plans.</p>\n<p>Investing in a good antivirus will help you keep your system free from any viruses or malware designed to expose your private information.</p>\n<h2>7. SECURE YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA PROFILES</h2>\n<p>It&rsquo;s fun to engage with different people on social platforms and share stories about your life events. However, you can let identity thieves take advantage of your information if it&rsquo;s not kept private.</p>\n<p>Review all your privacy settings to ensure what you share remains restricted to your network.</p>\n<h2>8. KEEP IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS IN A VAULT</h2>\n<p>Your important identification documents like birth certificates, social security cards, and more don&rsquo;t need to be accessed regularly. It&rsquo;s advisable to keep them secure in a lockbox, preferably a fireproof one.</p>\n<p>You can do the same for your online documents by keeping them securely in a lockbox, with complete encryption. By doing so, your sensitive online documents gain an extra layer of protection through encryption.</p>\n<h2>9. BEWARE OF PHISHING WEBSITES</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/6-common-phishing-scams-you-need-to-know-in-2021/\">Phishing websites</a> often mimic real websites to extract the all-important login credentials of users. Installing Trojans on systems has become tougher, but tricking people into giving away their credentials is still very easy to accomplish.</p>\n<p>Never try to access your bank accounts or any other accounts through links that you receive in your inbox. Visit the websites directly and always look for the <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/blogs/12-easy-ways-to-check-if-a-website-is-legit-or-a-scam/\">secure URL indicator</a> to remain protected.</p>\n<h2>10. STAY UPDATED</h2>\n<p>Data breaches related to bank accounts or any other personal information often receive wide coverage in the media. Use this information to check if any of your personal information has been compromised in any way.</p>\n<p>In case you discover that your data was compromised, you must quickly change the password of all your accounts. Be sure to follow other relevant safety tips listed by the account providers.</p>\n<h2>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h2>\n<p>Hackers are always on the prowl to steal sensitive personal information. While it&rsquo;s something inevitable, you can keep your personal information protected by following these vital rules.</p>\n<p>Also, you can consult experts who will provide you with additional information to keep yourself away from hackers.</p>\n",

            "content": "<p>Medical scams and malpractice are much more common than you think. According to estimates, more than 250,000 Americans lose their lives every year due to medical malpractice. Medical scams are also fairly common across the US. These schemes make use of different tactics in order to trap their targets.</p>\n<p>In fact, you may already have witnessed TV commercials from fraudulent medical brands. Victims of such frauds and malpractices may suffer in terms of their health or in the form of financial losses. The question is: how do I avoid these scams and malpractice?</p>\n<p>There are certain precautions that you need to take. These precautions include clear communication, discussing costs in advance, and mutually deciding timelines before going in for surgery or treatment. Discover the key aspects of medical deceptions and malpractice along with helpful advice related to avoiding these traps altogether.</p>\n<h2>WHAT ARE MEDICAL SCAMS</h2>\n<p>Medical scams can be executed in various forms. Common types include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Companies may sell you duplicate or malfunctioning medical products. Such products may not only lead to financial losses, but also result in major side effects too.</li>\n<li>Another type of scam involves excessive services being sold to you. This type of scheme typically happens at hospitals or healthcare facilities. When you go to these facilities to get treatment, you may be charged for services that you didn&rsquo;t even opt for.</li>\n<li>Medical fraud can also take place in the form of kickbacks. You may be referred to a particular MRI service provider in return for kickbacks even if it is not in your best interest.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>WHAT IS MEDICAL MALPRACTICE</h2>\n<p>Medical malpractice occurs when doctors or related professionals deviate from their usual standards related to healthcare. Here are a few common types of medical malpractice:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are many cases where doctors and healthcare professionals are negligent towards their contracted duties. Such negligence may result in severe illnesses and injuries for their patients.</li>\n<li>Another form of medical malpractice involves doctors using sub-standard procedures in order to save costs. Such practices can prove extremely dangerous for the patients.</li>\n<li>If a doctor conducts a particular treatment or surgery without your consent, then that can also be termed as a medical malpractice.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>HOW TO DETECT A SCAM OR MALPRACTICE</h2>\n<p>There are several things that you need to keep in mind if you want to avoid scams or malpractice. Here are a few pointers that will help you detect these instances:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The best policy is to discuss the key elements of your treatment or surgery with more than one healthcare provider. This will give you a better idea of the key aspects of the surgery and ensure that you are fully aware of what is involved.</li>\n<li>If you are still in doubt, you could contact your local Food and Drug Administration (FDA) office. The officials will guide you and ensure that you are not scammed.</li>\n<li>If the doctor or healthcare professional is being overly secretive about the terms of the treatment, that could be a major red flag. Doctors are not supposed to be secretive about their services. You should also be free to discuss the treatment with your family and friends.</li>\n<li>Another indicator can be if the doctor changes the course of the treatment without receiving your consent. You need to read all documents carefully before you sign them. This will protect you from scams of all types.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>WHAT TO DO IF YOU HAVE SUFFERED FROM A SCAM OR MALPRACTICE</h2>\n<p>In case you are not able to protect yourself from deception or malpractice despite your efforts, you do not need to worry. There are still ways to remedy the situation around by undertaking the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You could opt to file a lawsuit, however, this process may not be feasible due to the lengthy legal process and costs involved. Additionally, the healthcare provider may hire malpractice attorneys who are adept at stalling. Such tactics could drain your budget quickly.</li>\n<li>Another way is to file a chargeback claim. This method only applies if you paid for your treatment using a debit/credit card. The method is much smoother because it allows for a quicker resolution. Such a claim can be filed with your card company, and there are specialized consultants that can assist with filing these claims.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Medical scams and malpractice can take many different forms, still with the proper knowledge in hand, you can accurately detect frauds at an early stage or prevent any further losses.</p>\n<p>The best policy is to be fully aware of the treatment that you are going to undergo while maintaining clear communication with your doctors and healthcare providers.</p>\n<p>If you encounter any deviation from the best practices, you should immediately sound the alarm bells and seek outside consultation to ensure you can defend yourself against predatory practices.</p>\n",

            "content": "<p>Not many people are aware that insurance scams have become a multi-billion dollar business for criminals. These schemes prey on the fears and vulnerabilities of the public to cheat them out of money.</p>\n<p>Insurance scams can take on various forms such as bogus agents, robocalls, and overcharging. Accordingly, customers need to be extremely cautious about the insurance provider they select. Falling into the trap of a rogue company could result in significant damage. Avoiding such scams is even more important during the ongoing COVID-19 crisis as tricksters grow more active than usual.</p>\n<p>So how do you figure out if you are being scammed? There are certain things that you need to keep in mind before signing an insurance contract. This article discusses the different types of insurance fraud and provides you with tips that will help you in avoiding such traps. In addition, the article also provides a number of solutions if you have already fallen for one of these schemes.</p>\n<h2>TYPES OF INSURANCE SCAMS</h2>\n<p>Scams can take many forms, and the most common insurance scams that you need to defend against include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bogus agents can prove to be extremely hard to detect. Agents can look and sound authentic and pretend to be associated with major insurance brands. However, they are not what they appear, and making a payment to them may result in irrecoverable financial losses.</li>\n<li>Another form of fraudulent activity is robocalls. These are scammers who pretend to be from authorities such as the Social Security Administration (SSA). They may offer you fake insurance policies or arrange for fake COVID-19 tests.</li>\n<li>Phishing is another type of trap that is common in the insurance industry. This refers to unsolicited emails that ask you for your personal information in the name of an insurance provider. Once you provide the information, your account could be hacked, and funds could be siphoned off.</li>\n<li>Another fraud that has been rampant during the current pandemic is related to travel insurance. These fraudsters claim to payout present insurance claims that cover COVID-19 related problems in particular. These scammers need to be avoided at all costs.</li>\n<li>COVID-19 has also become a way to scare people into handing over their personal information. These cheaters often claim that they have access to testing kits or masks. They also claim to provide such equipment to you as part of an insurance contract. However, once you provide sensitive information, they never turn up.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>HOW TO IDENTIFY INSURANCE FRAUD</h2>\n<p>Considering the various forms in which insurance extortion can be executed, you must be able to identify potential scammers before they cause any serious damage. Here are a few pointers to help you out in this regard:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check the authenticity of the agent that has approached you. You could contact your local government authorities to verify their credentials.</li>\n<li>Go through the terms and conditions of the insurance contract before you sign it. Many people make the mistake of signing contracts in a hurry and then regretting decisions later.</li>\n<li>Never provide sensitive personal information to anyone over the phone or email. If you fall for one of these fraudsters, then it may be very difficult for you to recover your funds.</li>\n<li>Remember that if you are getting a deal that is too good to be true, then it is most likely a scam. You need to be vigilant and conduct your research before signing up for a new insurance policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>WHAT TO DO IF YOU HAVE BEEN SCAMMED</h2>\n<p>If you have already been tricked by a fraudulent insurance agent or company, you still have a couple of ways to manage the situation. Here&rsquo;s how:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>File a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). You can log on to their website and create a new complaint. You&rsquo;ll need to provide specific details about the insurance company or agent. The FTC will look into the matter and hopefully resolve it for you.</li>\n<li>Report the case to the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB). This bureau deals with all instances of insurance fraud and also runs a national helpline. You can simply call 1-800-TEL-NICB and provide all the information regarding the scam.</li>\n<li>Approach the insurance company that the agent is claiming to be from. The company may be able to help you out by clarifying the status of your contract, if indeed you have one.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Insurance deception takes many forms, but fortunately you can take steps to defend against these con artists with the tips detailed in this article. Insurance scams have become fairly common across the US and you need to be extremely careful before signing any documents.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, even if you have already been a victim of such schemes, you can still turn the situation around by taking timely action and reporting the incident to the relevant authorities.</p>\n",

            "content": "<p>Modern-day investors need to be wary of various types of scams. These scams may be in the form of accounting scandals, insider trading, or other forms of fraud. One such scheme is a pump and dump scam.</p>\n<p>Through this scam, investors of a particular stock promote the company extensively. Once hype has been created, these investors tend to sell their holdings to unsuspecting buyers, eventually leading to a sharp decline in the stock&rsquo;s share price. This situation results in ordinary investors suffering from huge financial losses.</p>\n<p>Explore the key aspects of such pump and dump scams to ensure you avoid falling prey to these schemes.</p>\n<h2>CREATING HYPE</h2>\n<p>The first part of these scams is that existing investors start to spread news and rumors about upcoming announcements that could lead to a sharp increase in share prices. These future announcements are touted as game-changers that could help spark a sharp move in higher valuations.</p>\n<p>The general motive is to create hype in the market and to increase the demand for shares. Many investors are attracted to such news and they purchase the stock in the hopes of making money. This increase in demand results in a short-term bump higher in the company&rsquo;s share price.</p>\n<h2>DUMPING THE STOCK</h2>\n<p>Once the share price has risen to a certain range, the original investors then begin to dump the stock, thereby realizing immense profits. However, when the market realizes that the original investors have backed out of the company, share prices begin to fall.</p>\n<p>The new investors who had been attracted to the share are now left exposed to heavy losses. Such a pump and dump fraud strategy can be extremely dangerous for young investors, and it can result in significant wealth erosion.</p>\n<h2>EXAMPLE OF A PUMP AND DUMP fraud</h2>\n<p>A recent example of a pump and dump scam was witnessed back in 2015. The scam was perpetrated in an American firm known as Jammin&rsquo; Java.</p>\n<p>The CEO and a few key promoters of the firm created a complex pump and dump scheme to cheat new investors. The fraudsters executed this crime by releasing fake and inaccurate newsletters about the company.</p>\n<p>Once these newsletters became popular online, a large number of new investors chose to purchase the shares of the firm. The fraudsters also created complex offshore entities in order to conceal and transfer funds from one place to another.</p>\n<p>The price of the company&rsquo;s stock stood at just $0.17 per share before the pump and dump scheme was executed. However, it reached an intra-day high of $6.35 per share after the hype was generated. Once the share price of the company shot up, the fraudsters chose to sell off their shares and realized significant profits.</p>\n<p>According to estimates provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the total profits realized by the fraudsters were in the range of $78 million. The CEO and eight other people were charged by the SEC under a civil complaint.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>It is clear that pump and dump scams can be extremely damaging for investors. These scams are executed in a complex manner so that new investors are unaware of the fact that they are being cheated.</p>\n<p>The example discussed above also shows that the top management of firms can also be involved in these scams. Therefore, investors need to be really careful before investing in a stock that has been overhyped. Conducting thorough research is a good way to ensure that you are protected against these scams.</p>\n",

            "content": "<p>In 1971, when President Richard Nixon allowed the US dollar to float freely against other currencies, he effectively created the modern-day forex market. Investors realized that there was money to be made from fluctuations in currency markets, by buying low and selling high.</p>\n<p>Two more recent developments have helped to make forex the most popular market in the world. First, the internet has made forex trading incredibly accessible, quick, and easy. And secondly, increasing globalization has opened up many new markets and new opportunities.</p>\n<p>Whether you&rsquo;re a government treasury, financial institution, billionaire speculator, or individual trader, the principles behind forex are the same. Foreign exchange is simply the transfer of currency from one party to another, at a mutually agreeable price. And the way to make money on forex is equally simple: buy a currency when it&rsquo;s low in value, and sell it when it&rsquo;s high.</p>\n<p>There are various more sophisticated takes on the forex market (spot markets, forward markets, future markets, options markets, swaps markets, and so on) &#8211; but the basic principles remain the same in all cases.</p>\n<p>The ultimate example of forex trading was George Soros, who allegedly made over $1 billion by betting against the value of the pound back in 1992. Soros made his fortune in this case by shorting, a practice where you sell a currency with the intention of repurchasing it later at a lower price.</p>\n<h2>THE VITAL ROLE OF FOREX REGULATION</h2>\n<p>Before you invest a single red cent in forex, you should check out the website of your national financial regulator. And even if you&rsquo;re an experienced trader, you should regularly do the same. Regulators are the definitive source of information on the latest scams, and have practical advice to help you stay safe.</p>\n<p>They are now reporting an ever-increasing number of scams. This only serves to underline the importance of national authorities who police the markets and protect investors. They ensure that brokers do business within the rules, and should something go wrong, at least you have some form of comeback.</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/3cb63f369184927bf33e79fee0e77f69.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/3cb63f369184927bf33e79fee0e77f69.jpg\" width=\"453\" height=\"340\"></picture></p>\n<p>Regulators can provide you a register of authorized firms, and, perhaps more crucially, a warning list of companies to avoid.</p>\n<p>If you have any doubts about the importance of foreign exchange regulation and forex regulatory bodies, speak to someone who has had a bad experience with an unregulated broker. After that conversation, you will only ever work with a company with a forex license!</p>\n<p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/ecf688a1c3f27e3d264969b86f65bd6d.webp\"></source><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/pb-posts/ecf688a1c3f27e3d264969b86f65bd6d.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\"></picture></p>\n<h2>CORE FOREX REGULATORY BODIES</h2>\n<p>latest statistics from the Bank of International Settlements make for interesting reading. According to their figures, trades in the UK make up a huge 43% of the overall forex market. The next biggest player is the USA (16.5%), followed by Singapore (7.7%) and Hong Kong (7.6%).</p>\n<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the dollar is overwhelmingly the most popular choice, followed by the Euro, Yen and Pound. These four form the most popular currency pairings, so let&rsquo;s take a look at who&rsquo;s responsible for forex regulation and control in each of those jurisdictions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>UK</strong>: Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)</li>\n<li><strong>USA</strong>: The National Futures Association (NFA) Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)</li>\n<li><strong>Singapore</strong>: Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)</li>\n<li><strong>Hong Kong</strong>: Hong Kong Securities And Futures Commission (HKSFC)</li>\n<li><strong>EU</strong>: the EU directive Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID)</li>\n<li><strong>Japan</strong>: Financial Services Agency (FSA).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It goes without saying that if you&rsquo;re trading in the above countries, you should only ever work with companies that are registered with the relevant forex regulatory bodies. If you&rsquo;re trading in other countries, always make sure you follow the same advice.</p>\n<h2>THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF AVOIDING UNREGULATED FOREX BROKERS</h2>\n<p>Some <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/forex-scams/\">forex scammers</a> have conned investors by registering in lightly-regulated countries, or by falsely claiming to be registered overseas. Other common tactics include Ponzi schemes offering unreal returns, the promise of guaranteed profits, cloned copies of genuine websites, and false celebrity endorsements. Investors are mindful of these cons &hellip; yet every year, people still fall for them.</p>\n<p>A recent example in the US is Black Diamond Forex, where bogus trader Michael Salerno ran a variety of scams, including what was effectively a Ponzi scheme. Somewhat surprisingly given his criminal background, Salerno&rsquo;s company Black Diamond was actually registered with the CFTC, but at least his victims were able to seek some form of restitution, and have the satisfaction of seeing the perpetrator jailed and banned.</p>\n<p>There are no such provisions if you use an unregistered broker. You wouldn&rsquo;t trust your healthcare to an unregulated doctor, so why would you trust your hard-earned cash to an unregulated broker?</p>\n<h2>WHAT TO DO IF YOU&rsquo;VE BEEN SCAMMED BY AN UNREGULATED FOREX BROKER</h2>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve been scammed by an unregulated forex broker, you may believe that you have no comeback whatsoever. However, there may be one last chance for you, in the form of firms offering specialist fund recovery services.</p>\n<p>These professionals have an impressive track record in helping victims of scammers to get their money back. Companies like <a href=\"https://payback-ltd.com/\">Payback</a> employ experienced financial and legal experts, and they know exactly what to do when faced with unregulated forex brokers. They can often succeed where other approaches have failed. If you&rsquo;ve been a victim of forex crime, you should definitely give them a try.</p>\n",
